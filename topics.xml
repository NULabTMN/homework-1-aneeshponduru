SOME CARNEGIE HIST6RY.
Crushing Power of The Great Iron Com
pany Untold Wealth.
The bitter struggle at Homestead
between organized workmen on the one
hand and organized millionaires on the
other, gives to the phenomenal career of
Andrew Carnegie, the chief of capital's
iidc in the controversy, a special interest
to Americans, who arc called upon to
lecide by their votes whether or not
they indorse a system which has made
such wholcsarb money-gathering possiblo
to any man, The history of Carnegie's
wealth-making is one of the most extra
ordinary in the history of the United
States, and he differs from every other
American millionaire in his ambitions
and achievements no less than in the use
he has made of his wealth, the distinct
ions which he has striven to obtain, and
the curious mixture of socialism and
imperialism which go to make up his
character.
People in general who read about the
6trikc at Homestead have no idea of the
extent of the Carnegie industries of
wiiich that will, with it3 thousands of
workmen, is but one among many.
Even in Pittsburg, under the shadow of
he vast commercial house which Mr.
Carnegie has built iip, there are thou
Eands of people with no adequate idea
of its extent and resources, of the crush
ing power with which it has stamped
out aspiring rivals or the millions of
profit which it has reaped and of the
long line of huge iron industries which
it has swallowed one after another.
People who read the accounts of the
strike are confused by Various names cm
ployed. There is talk cf Carnegie,
Phipps Co., of the Bessemer Steel Co.,
of the Lucy Furnace, of the Keystone
Bridge Co., of the llartmnn Steel Co. of
Carnegie brothers although there is
now only one Carnegie of the Edgar
Thompson mills and of the Homestead
mills, with a host of others. They all
are Carnegie industries, although
Andrew Carnegie has no share in their
management. The man at the head of
affairs is the Mr. Frick who is taking all
the responsibility. Ho is the head" oFtlie
new concern, the Carnegie Steel Co.
(Limited), which came into being a few
weeks ago and which embraces all the
industries absorbed by Carnegie or
started by him up to date.
This huge ocropus has so many arms
and tentacles t hat only people in the iron
trade arc aware of its vamilicatiens.
Yet the rise of Carnegie and the story of
his life arc as much a wonder to them as
if they knew nothing of the man who
has made himself master of the greatest
industry in the new world. Carnegie
not only founded a great house, but he
has invented a new business maxim and
followed it with marvelous success.
When he ceased to be a telegraph
operator and went into business with
his brother Tom and D. A Stewart,
Carnegie laid it down as a fundamental
principle upon which the partnership
should be conducted that when a partner
died his estate should bo settled up
within thirty days and his interest in the
business acquired by the remaining
partners, and also that no son or child of
any of them should have a share in the
concern or a voice in its management.
This policy has been rigidly followed
down to the present; The consequence
has been that the partnerehip from time
to time has been refreshed and invigor
ated by infusions of new blood and the
active managers have been young and
energetic men. )Yrhcnevcr an employe
or a successful man in some outside but
collateral businees, as in the case of
Frick, displayed unusual ability and
energy, he was taken in, given a share
in the profits and pushed rapidly to the
front.
Both David A. Stewart and Tom Car
negie, who formed tbe original copart
nership with Andrew Carnegie, are now
dead, and each died a many times
millionaire at a time when the business
had not anything like its present
proportions but was growing rapidly.
Mr. Stewart left two sons and Tom
Carnegie more than half a dozen, yet
none of these young men were allowed
to come into the concern, and the estates
of their fathers were settled up im
mediately after death and the business
continued by Andrew Carnegie. The
consequence' has been that the active
management of" the business has been
intrusted to bright and active men wlib
have grown up on iron.
All of theso partners have become
millionaires. To be suro thGy are not
millionaires of the Carnegie magnitude,
having to strugglo along with from one
to ten million!. This was the case with
Henry Phipps. He is one of mlnoi
partners, whose name has not even been
mentioned in connection with the Home
stead strike, and yet he lives in England
in a palace and maintains an establish
ment like one of the princes of the blood.
Indeed there is not in England a princ
with a house as line as Kneb worth Park.
Stevenage, Herts, where Henry Phippi
and his family are now residing.
This magnificent house is the count rj
stat of the Lyttons, and from there the
late Lytton was buried. Knebwoith
which has an immense aemcsnc ana ar
estate of thousands of acres, with every
thing which wealth, care and time car
add to make it a delight to the eye, wai
at one time a royal palace, and has beer
in the family of the Lyttons since abou1
1470. It was purchased then by Sii
Robert de Lytton, who was Undei
Treasurer jof the Exchequer to Ilenrj
VII., and Queen Elizabeth with othe;
subsequent sovereigns have been enter
taincd within its ample walls
The fortunate tenant of this establish
ment has, however, been through tin
mill at Pittsburg, and the yeMv of'tol
lie has put in piling up the Carnegie
millions as well as his own entitle him
to the case and comfort which it is
presumed he now enjoys there. Mr.
Phipps, who, unlike Carnegie, lias never
aspired to literary or political distinct
ion, was recently presented at court,
with his daughter and other members of
his family. Rigged out in the ornate
costume which a man is obliged to put
on when he goes to court, the partner of
Andrew Carnegie may be highly
Interesting from a picturesque stand
point, but does not add much to the
dignity of American citizenship.
Carnegie, as the cable has told the
puUic, is living now in lordly luxury at
Cluny Castle, Scotland. 1
Here is what a recent writer had to
say about the goings-on at the castle
"Mr. Carnegie has a pljjer of his own,
who pipes each day for dinner, the
company marching two and two behind
him thrice around the hall in solemn
Srocession until led by the host to tho
Ining-room." The same writer, in
farther description of this famous piper,
says that ho is always "resplendent in
tho Carnegie tartan." Thcro is no
Carnegie tartan, and James Grant's
book, "Tho Tartans of tho Clans of
Scotland," docs not CTcn mention tho
name of the family. Tho "Carnegie
Tartan," therefore, which tho piper at
Cluny Castle wears, must not only havo
been made out of whole cloth, bujt it
must havo been invented by Mr. Car
negie. Perhaps he wears tho kilt him
self. People who know Carnegie havo
told him that his manly form coald be
set off to no better effect than if he were
to don the cap, the stocktngs and the
sporran. f"v i
III3 NEW niGIILAKD SEAT. I
But ho is now at Cluny Castle.
Klnlochrannoch, Perthshire, is the name
of his new country seat fn the, Highlands',
and here his grounds embrace thousands
of acres of mountain and moorland,
brawling burn and silvery loch.
In Ids splendid house in New York,
No. 5 west Fifty-first street, Carnegie,
who has filled tho establishment with
Scotch servants, has invented a coat-of-arms
which reporters who have Inter
viewed him in his library hav.e seen
emblazoned on tho walls. It consists of
loaves of bread quartered with a knife,
sausagos, heads of cabbages, etc., in
yules, azuro and ermine and all painted
with a wretched disregard of art.
Much attention is given to Spain'
young six-year-old king. The proba
bilities are that when that kid is old
enough to be a king the world will bo
too wise to admit of any such foolish
ness even in old bcnjclitcd Spain.
Sixty-cent wheat, five-cent cotton,
lower prices for cattle and everything
else produced are arguments that are
silently but surely doing a work in
opening the eyes of men that have here
tofore been deaf to the appeals of
reason.

hoped by the managers of the Croker-Devery

York to believe that Mr. Carnegie indorsed the
Tammany administration, and would aid the
organization in perpetuating its misrule of the
city. Mr. Carnegie was in Europe when the

		Nine! The deep-toned bell of the
cathedral clock in Andrew Carnegie's
mansion at Fifth avenue and Ninety
first street, New York, has chimed
the quarters in a musical scale, and
is booming the hour as the master
reaches the doorway of his workshop.
As he stands for a moment on the
threshold of his library, his small,
lithe figure is the incarnation of quiet
force and nervous energy. He has
said publicly that he is out of busi­
ness for good. He is about to begin
a busy day, in the course of which
he will accomplish twice as much
work as many a man in the hurly
burly of lower Broadway who is still
in active command of his forces as a
captain of industry.
System is Andrew Carnegie's
watchword. Although no longer
directing the movements of 200,000
employes in the great steel works
and other enterprises with which his
name was so long associated, he con­
tinues to be the man of affairs, and
each day brings its iabors, none the
less exacting because they are pri­
marily for the good of humanity and
not for personal gain.
It is estimated that Mr. Carnegie's
income is $15,000,000 a year. Of this
he gives away two-thirds at least.
Exactly how much of his fortune is
dispensed in public and private gifts
no one knows but himself. To dis­
tribute money so that the greatest
good to the greatest number shall re­
sult is the business of his life, and
he devotes at least ten hours a day
to this task with all the vigor and
concentrated shrewdness which have
made the former peasant boy of Dun­
fermline one of the wealthiest men
in the world.
Ah, the morning papers! To read
some of them and look through the
rest is the first thing to be done. Mr.
Carnegie is a rapid reader, and as
his interest extends to all parts of
the world, it is well that he is, for he
reads everything1 in the paper, from
the foreign cable dispatches to a
skimming over the advertisements.
The papers disposed of, he rings
for his secretary, James Bertram, a
Scot, like his employer quick-witted,
too, or he never would do for Andrew
Carnegie.
"What's new, Bertram?" he asks,
pleasantly* as he picks up one of the
pile of letters which have been placed
at his elbow, open and ready to be
scanned.
"Nothing particular You will find
several orpin requests in that pile
which look all right, and there is an
answer from that Indiana town about
their library. There are two person-'
al letters for you, too.* Oh, yes, you
have them."
This with Scottish directness and
military brevity, as Mr. Carnegie
breaks the seal of one of the two let­
ters, 'which have been placed on his
table unopened. Very

York Hortie—Perfect System in Each Hour of Labor.
any misconception, let it be said
here, positively, that writing the word
"Personal" on an envelope will not
deter the secretary from opening it.
Mr. Carnegie has gone through the
first letter and makes a short memo­
randum on it. The same with several
others. Then he takes up one from
a Western city which tells him that
the authorities there have decided
not to accept his offer of a library
because public feeling is against
using the required sum from the
municipal treasury every year to
support it. He elevates his eyebrows
in a shadow of vexation, and dictates
a reply to Bertram, who jots it down
in shorthand. The reply is courteous.
It expresses regret that the town will
not take a library, on the terms of­
fered, but declares emphatically that
the conditions which govern all other
library endowments cannot be modi­
fied in this case.
By the time the correspondence is
disposed of, and Mr. Bertram's note­
book is full of pothooks for Campbell
to turn into typewritten letters, the
forenoon is well advanced, and a pile
of newspapers from other dfties, in
America, q.nd abroad, are ready for
Mr. Carnegie's attention. He reads
the mall. Many are complimentary,
but there are some which criticise
the use he makes of his wealth, or
take issue with certain opinions he
may have expressed in speeches,
magazine essays or newspaper inter­
views.
All of these receive due considera­
tion and even when a prominent hum­
orist raps him hard—as one did
a few weeks ago—he only smiles in­
dulgently. N6 one realizes better
than Andrew Carnegie that to be in
the limelight of public view means
many an unkind comment, as well as
a fair quantity of praise, so he takes
the bitter with the sweet with equal
composure.
It is now time for luncheon. Mr.
Carnegie steps into one of the auto­
matic elevators and is taken to the
dining room. There is not much done
in Mr. Carnegie's room for an hour
'or two after dinner. He has spent
more than an hour at luncheon, in
domestic privacy, and when he re­
turns to his den it is to sit quietly
reading for hour before the car­
riage fs announced fort the afternoon
drive in the park.
But he cannot spend much time in
the park this afternoon, for he is due
to attend the opening of one of his
libraries on the east side. He has
promised to be present and make a
short address, and he will keep' his
word. The carriage has heen ordered
to be in readiness on his return from
his walk, and by 4 o'clock he is on
the platform in the new building, fac­
ing a large audience He shakes
hands with a few scores of persons,
and is rescued' from some hundreds
of others who would like to grasp his
hand, and drives back to his home.
He is Jin particularly good spirit
now, and id ready for a lot more'cor­
respondence. There have been sev­
eral mails in the course of the day,
and the mountain of letters which the
secretary has winnowed has resulted
in a pile for his personal considera­
tion even larger than that which
faced him in the morning. He goes
through them rapidly, and then he
has the' evening NeV York papers
and a lot of blue penciled papers from
other cities.
Visitors have been coming and
going all day, but, with the exception
of a. committeeman, he has not seen
any of them. He has a public dinner
engagement at the Waldorf-Astoria
for the evening, and has no time to
talk to any one whose business is not
imperative.
Six o'clock sounds from the big
hall clock and its companions, and
Bertram and Campbel disappear. As
they go out a cheery voice is heard
in the hall, and Mr. Carnegie smiles.
He recognizes the tones. In another
inoment, Charles M. Schwab, presi­
dent of the United States Steel Cor­
poration to the world at large, but
"Charlie" to Andrew Carnegie, is
seated in the den, laughing and talk­
ing. They may talk steel business,
but if they do it is only in a casual
way. Andrew Carnegie has passed
through a busy day, and he has still
that dinner to attend at the Waldorf
Astoria.
"Let's have some music," suggests
Mr: Carnegie, leading the way to the
magnificent pipe organ, which is one
of the luxurious features of the Car­
negie palace.
"All right," responds "Charlie," as
he seats himself in front of the in­
strument, "what shall it be?"
Andrew Carnegie has dropped into
a chair in front of the fireplace, and
his gaze is fixed among the red coals.
He smiles without answering. The
fingers of the musician sweep the
keys and "Ye Banks and Braes" thun­
ders through the great house. Then
comes "Annie Laurie," followed by
"The Bluebells of Scotland." The
quiet figure In the chair is* perfectly
still, save for a gentle nodding of the
head in time to the thrilling melody
that brings back old memories, old
times and many faces dead and gone.
Again the air changes and there are
tears in the music as the organ seems
to say articulately, "Robin, Robin
Adair."
Perhaps there are tears in the keen
blue eyes of the great multi-million­
aire and philanthropist, sitting so
quietly before the fire. If there are,
they cannot be seen, for the night
has been closing in and the musi­
cian is playing by the sense of touch
alone, as the listened still looks into
the red coals, dteaming, dreaming,
dreaming.—New York Herald.

Third Man Injured In Civil War.
We clip the following from the Peo­
ple's Journal, Scotland's greatest week­
ly, on Andrew Carnegie, who is known
across the water as "The Laird of
Skibo," and which may be of interest
to our readers:
The Carnegie week in Piitsburg was
recently celebrated with great rejoic­
ings. As in former years stories of the
millionaire and incidents of his early
life were on everybody's lips. It was
stated that Andrew Carnegie came by
his fondness for books and libraries in
a legitimate way. His father was a
Scotch Liberal, a weaver of Dunferm­
line, and was one of three men, all
weavers, who, 75 years ago, gathered
their little handful of books together,
and placed them at the disposal of their
fellow-workmen. Shortly after Andrew
Carnegie graduated from the woollen
mills of Allegheny and became a mes­
senger boy in the Pittsburg "Tele­
graph" office, he had his own first ex­
perience with libraries and librarians
in his attempt to acquire knowledge.
At that time there was a wretched little
free library in Allegheny on Federal
street, just above Colonade Row, the
property made famous in the Jack Rob­
inson will case in Media. Andrew Car­
negie made aplication for books, and
was refused on the plea that he was
not a "working boy." At that time
clerks, telegraph operators, and other
boys and young men not employed in
mills, factories, or workshops were not
regarded as "working boys", and as
he was a telegraph operator young Car­
negie was refused the privilege of the
library. At this time young Carnegie,
as he subsequently confessed, had a
burning desire to become a reporter
and subsequent the editor of a news­
paper. He did not achieve his ambi­
tion, but he has always been exceed­
ingly ready with his pen and tongue.
Stung by his rebuff at the Allegheny
library young Carnegie made an attack
on that institution in the Pittsburg
"Dispatch," over the signature "Work­
ing Boy," with such signal success that
he forced the librarian to ask an inter­
view, at which the differences were ad­
justed and Carnegie was admitted to
its privileges on the score of being a
"working boy."
One of the three "don'ts" credited to
Mr. Carnegie is "don't speculate." The
other two are "don't drink," and "don't
Indorse." And yet Andrew Carnegie's
colossal fortune is based on speculation.
With a number of others, shortly after
the oil excitement broke out in north­
western Pennsylvania, Mr. Carnegie
took a "flyer" in petroleum, and pur­
chased 300 shares of stock in the Storey
Oil farm, on Oil Creek. Oil was as
great a gamble then as it is today,
and so Mr. Carnegie took the risk. Luck
was on his side, as it has ever been.
At first the venture did not promise
to be a success. He became discour­
aged, and sold one-third of his stock
at a nominal figure. He went to Scot­
land on a visit, and while there some
big wells wer struck, and he came back
to find that his shares were worth
hundreds of thousands of dollars. His
ultimate profit was $1,000,000. While a
great deal has been said about Andrew
Carnegie, very little is heard about his
brother, Thomas, or "Tom," as he was
familiarly known in Pittsburg. Thomas
Carnegie was the antithesis of his
brother Andrew. He was tall and slen­
der, and did not bear the marks of his
Scottish origin as plainly upon his face
as his elder brother. He was a nervous,
wiry man, whose inseparable compan­
ion was a Pittsburg "stogie." He was
a partner in the Carnegie interests,
president in fact, and was lifted into
financial and social life by Andrew as
the latter rose. Thomas Carnegie has
been dead a dozen years, and is almost
forgotten now by all save his associates
of that time.
The old Hope cotton mill in Allegheny
where "Andy" Carnegie worked is still
standing, although it is not in opera­
tion. From the cotton mill he rose to
be a messenger boy, and it all came
about through his father's love of play­
ing checkers. The elder Carnegie used
to visit Pittsburg to meet some check
er-playing cronies, among whom was
Jofon Brooks, then a clerk or manager
in the Pittsburg Telegraph office. One
night Mr. Carnegie, in speaking of his
elder son, said that he did not know
what he was going to do with Andrew.
"Send him over and I will make a mes­
senger boy of him," replied Brooks.
Tliat is how Carnegie got into the tele­
graph business. In the same office with
him as messenger boys were four other
lads who have since become famous
in one way or another. They were
Robert Pitcairn, now superintendent of
the Pittsburg division of the Pennsyl­
vania railroad, and many times a mil
ion aire Henry W. Oliver, another great
iron master of Pittsburg, whom it is
said Senator Quay has selected for his
successor in the senate David M'Cargo,
another railroad man, and William C.
Moreland, for many years. a leading
lawyer of Pittsburg. Andrew Carnegie
was one of the little handful of men
who witnessed an epoch in telegraphy
45 years ago. It was the sending of thq
first message from New Orleans to New
York. It was considered a wonderful
thing, almost impossible of achieve­
ment.
In those days operators worked on
short circuits, but the managers de­
cided to try the experiment of wiring
from the far south to the north. James
D. Reid was general superintendent of
the telegraph line, with headquarters
in Pittsburg. On the day set for the
trial, Superintendent Reid, David
Brooks, and Carnegie, M'Cargo, Oliver
Pitcairn, and Moreland, who were then
operators, gathered round the instru­
ment adjusted for the purpose. At a
signal, New York called Philadelphia,
Philadelphia called Harrisburg, and
then in quick succession Pittsburg, Cin­
cinnati, Louisville, Memphis, and New
Orleans opened. In describing that
scene, one of the number said recently:
—"For a moment there was absolute
silence in the office. No one seemed to
breathe, so great was the tension. Then
came a few faint ticks growing louder,
and an instant later an unbroken mes­
sage was sent between the north and
the south." In every instaiice the men
who have cast in their lot with Andrew
Carnegie have been lifted into wealth
and prominence. Those who have
dropped out have not always retained
their good luck. The latter is the case
of some of his old partners. Andrew
Carnegie is what the Rothschilds would
call a "lucky man." Their house will
have nothing to do with unlucky men.
Andrew Carnegie would be a perfect
treasure to them. One of the little
known episodes in Andrew Carnegie's
life is his connection with the civil war.
He was the third man wounded during
the Rebellion. When Thomas A. Scott
undertook to help President Lincoln as
assistant secretary of war in the mat­
ter of railway transportation. Carnegie
was placed in charge of a portion of the
telegraph work. He followed General
Butler's troops southward on an engine.
He rode on the pilot inspecting the
wires. At one point between Eldridge
Junction and Washington he found that
the Confederates had 'grounded" the
wires by pinning them to the earth. He
stopped the engine to release them. As
he did so one of the wires bounded up,
cutting a deep gash in his cheek, and
he entered Washington his face cov­
ered with blood.
Some years ago Mr. Carnegie was
asked to make a subscription toward
a library at Lincoln, Neb. The first 25
dollars had been given by an Omaha
man, Mr. Rosewater, of the "Bee."
Years before this Mr. Rosewater had
been a telegraph operator at the time
that young Carnegie was also an oper­
ator in Pittsburg. They had "talked"
frequently over the wire between the
cities where they were employed, but
had never met. It was Mr. Rosewater
who made the request for a donation
from Mr. Carnegie. It was forthcoming
very promptly, and in sending a mag­
nificent subscription Mr. Carnegie re­
cognized the bond of a telegraphic
brotherhood in a peculiar way. Down
in a corner of the letter below his sig­
nature he wrote "Sevnty-three," which
in the sound manual of the telegraphers
is a code signal used in exchanging
greetings. It was his greeting with his
check to his former brother telegrapher.</text>

		Andrew Carnegie, Maker of Millionaires
Deceased Ironmaster, While Rolling Up His Billion, Made Millionaires of More Than
Twoscorc Partners, Men Picked Fzom the Throng Because of Their Potential Ability
Many of These Men, Such as Schwab, Frick and Corey, To-Day Rank Among the
Wealthiest Men of the World.
ALL great captains of Industry
and finance In gaining great
ncnes tnemaeives maice oiner
men rich, but with the excoptlon of
Plcrpont Morgan sr., who dollbor-
ately picked out young men and
guided tbem along the paths leading to
wealth, Andrew Carnegie waa the
only autocrat of Industry and finance
who ever designedly made the fash
ioning of millionaires a by-product of
his own wealth-accruing activities.
He was a pioneer In that line, biasing
the way when millionaires were com
paratively scarce In Uila country, nnd
his by-products. In tho ranks of whom
are such men as Cbarlea M. Schwab,
Henry C. Frick and William B. Corey,
to-day rank among the wealthiest
men of the worm.
In his early days Andrew Carnegie,
by vlrtuo of his Scotch blood, waa a be
liever In Individual industry aud fru
gality. In his memolra he says be ac
cumulated his first $1,000 by saving
the money a few dollars at a time, but
other paaaagea Indicate that he had a
winning way and waa able to procure
aid from banks and capitalists In lay
ing the foundation of his fortune. Do
that as It may, he waa a believer
hard work and aavlng habits, but he
waa not long In coming to the Idea
that the short cut to wealth Is through
the efforts of others.
His first job entailing responsibility
was assistant to Thomas A. Scott. Su
perintendent of the Pennsylvania Rail
road Col Scott was a railroad man of
the old school. He believed In doing all
the Important work of his office with
his own hands, and he trained young
Carnegie along those lines.
"But," wrote Mr. Carnegie, "a few
years ago, after he had retired from
business, "I think Mr. Scott ,and I
were the most foolish men In the
world In that respect
"It took me some time to learn, but
I did learn that the supremely great
managers such aa you have In these
days never do any wprk themselves
worth speaking about; their point la
to make others work while they think.
I applied this lesson In after life, so
that business with mo baa never been
a care,
Col. Scott by the way, waa one of
Andrew Carnegie's first by-products.
Impressed by Carnegie's business abll
Ity, Col. Scott gave tho young man
his first opportunity to make money
outside his pay by advising blm to
buy (S00 worth of Adams Express
Company shares and to Invest $500 In

When Andrew Carnegie went into the
steel business ho made Col Scott one
of his partners and one of the early
steel millionaires.
When ho had foreseen that steam
railway would soon be compelled to
replace, their wooden bridge's by steel
structures ami had decided to make
the steel bridges Andrew Carnegie
cast about for likely young men to
aid blm In his enterprise. He found
ed In the early seventies the Key
atone Drldgo Company. His original
partners were William P. Shlnn,
David McCandless, nenry Phipps and
Thomas Carncg'e. These partners
conducted the plant and Andrew
Carnegie raised the money and sold
the goods and attended to the adver
tising. Ho wna tho first great Indus
trial press, agent, and his methods
awed and disgusted the,old timers In
the steel business, but he got the
business and the money. Subsequent
ly he took into the Keystone Drldgo
Company Thomas N. Miller, William
Coleman, Andrew Klomon, J. Edgar
Thompson, John Scott, DaVId A. Stew
art and John W. Vandervoort
The steel Industry waa flourishing
In Western Pennsylvania and North
ern Ohio In a small way. The meth
ods of the old-timers were conserva
tlve. Andrew Carnegie's bridge con
cent grew like a mushroom and he
began learning things about the ateel
manufacturing business every mln
ute. He found that many labor eav
lng and productldn speeding devices
had beon Ignored by tho steel Makers
and that therp were Jn the trade many
young, ambitious men who were not
getting a chance. He gathered up
some of these 'young men and wont
Into the steel business.
Aided by a prohibitive tariff and tho
tremendous railroad expansion In the
late seventies, the Carnegie enterprises
would have grown to great propor
Uons along natural business channels,
but he forced them. He began in
anlrlng his superintendent and sub-
superintendents by gifts of atock In
the concsrn. He made them partnsr,

three of these partners, ,not one of
whom bad paid a cent for stock which
was earning from $0 to 60 per cent
per annum. He drove these men aa
Simon Legree drove Uncle Tom, but
ho waa a benevolent Simon Lcgree.
He ro warded toll munificently and he
weeded out the men who could not
stand the pace with scant ceremony
or consideration. Occasionally a val
ued partner -would break down. He
would be promptly ptgeonbold and a
new, eager, striving, ruthless young
man would take his place.
The army of clerks In the Carnegie
enterprises were keyed up to the ut
most endeavor by promises dangling
always before them of stock bonuses
nnd promotions to salesmanships or
superintendences. In the mills, the
skilled workers were paid ataggorlng
iagea and many with Ideas were
picked for promotion. Of the thirty
three partners of Andrew Carnegie In
1S$9, only three had more than an
elementary school education. The
others had gone into the milts as
boys and worked their way up.
Those were rough, strenuous days.
Andrew Carnegie applied to the fullest
extent of his remarkablo powers of
organization his point "to make
others work while I think." Henry
C. Frlok, one of his partners at that
period, brought to the Carnegie Inter-
ests five-sixths of the Henry W.
Oliver holdings in the Mesaba ore
range without the actual expenditure
of a cent Later. Frick had a falling
out with Carneglo hlch resulted In
the reorganization of the Carneglo
interests. For hla services In bringing
about this reorganization, James D,
Dill, the corporation attorney, was
paid a fee of 1.000,000,
When J. P. Morgan and the, allied
Wall Street Interests saw that the
Indomitable Carnegie, who thought
all the time and drove others to work
for him all the time, was In a fair
way to carry out his threat that he
would grab control of the steel and
ore business of the continent they
bought him out He had forty-
four partners; none of whom had paid
a dollar for his stock, and all were In
the millionaire class or approaching
It Many others bad dropped out of
the organization either to retire from
business or to go Into aome branch
of the ateel Industry on theJr own
account
Among those millionaires who wero
the by-products of Mr. Carnegie's
closing years In business were Wll
Horn E. Corey, Charles M, Schwab,
George Lauder, James Qaylct A. T.
Dinkey, F. T.. F. Lovejoy, John a. A.
Lelshman, P. T. Derg. Henry Docnth-
rager, Thomas Lynch, W. W. Black
burn and H. P. Dope. All of the
partners, who were active to tho close
of Mr. Carnegie's control, profited by
tho sale of the Carneglo steel in
terests to the United States 3teel
Corporation and named the President
of the United States Steel Corpora
tion for five years after bo retired
from active business.
The formation of the United States
Steel Corporation was the means of
making millionaires of hundreds of
men. who had not been with tho Car
negie organization, and theso are In
direct! responsible to Carnegie for
their wealth, for he made possible
the United Statca Steel Corporation.
Tho aggregate wealth of tho million
aires Andrew Carnegie mode directly
or Indirectly amounts to many times
more than Carnegie's fortune at the
peak of his prosperity.
After he retired from business he
looked after the widows of many of
the. men he had raised to wealth, pay
lng them 6 per cent on their money
and protecting them In their holdings
by bond. At one time he had on his
books the names of 148 of these
widow depositors and the amount ho
held for them waa $$,1S7,82.20.

		STEEL MASTER BEGAN
TO SAVE WHEN YOUNG
Recognized That Success Lay In Sound
Investment-Safest Security in
World Is Now Offered By
Government.
Andrew Carnegie died not long ago,
leaving behind him $30,000,000. He
had given away about $300,000,000 in
an effort to avoid the reproach of
dying rich.
It is probable that the high cost of
living gave the "steel master" little
worry during th? latter half of his
life, but it is certain that in his boy
hood the prices of the necessaries of
life were vital factors. And Andrew
Carnegie in his early years met'the1
cost of living with the same remedy
which America's leaders, headed by
President Wilson, are now putting
?h as the biaic principle of the
t to withstand the menace that
s in the soaring prices of today,
t remedy IB thrift-the practice of
ng, the elimination of waste and
id investment,
the days when Andrew Carnegie,
?ears old, earned $1.20 a week as
abbin boy in an Allegheny City
on mill, and later when he earned
25 a month as a telegraph mes
:er boy, the cost of living meant
h to him. He had little margin
for saving. But he did save. There
were few opportunities for the small
saver to make safe investments. Se
curities were not issued in small de
nominations. There were no Thrift
Stamps or War Savings Stamps,
backed by the government, into which
the meager proceeds of the Scotch
boy's thrift could be converted.
But Andrew Carnegie at the age of
20 determined upon safe investment.
The soundest securities that offered
were 10 shares of stock in an express
company worth $600. Carnegie had to
borrow part of the money he paid.
But he was convinced that savings ly
ing idle were not performing their
proper function.
The American man or woman, boy
or girl of today does not have to bor
row to add to the savings fund in or
der to find safe investment. The gov
ernment makes sound security in the
form of Savings Stamps, Trtasury
Savings Certificates, and war bonds
available to /ery saver who will be
gin to practice thrift by the regular in
vestment of sums as small as 25
cents.
Every American today has a better
opportunity for success than lay be
fore Andrew Carnegie when he faced
the world.

		The Fruits of a Fortune
What should a rich man do with his money
^Andrew (arnegie's answer was to invest one

work forever to improve man's lot. Dfow the whole
world is celebrating the centennial of his birth

Andrew Carnegie was bom at Dun
fermline, in Scotland, on November
25. 1835. The centenary of his birth
is now to be celebrated in most
distinguished manner both in the United
States and in Great Britain. These celebra
tions will be echoed throughout the civilized
world, for there is no land in which Mr.
Carnegie's name is not known and none
which the influence of his idealism and fore
sight have not reached.
To what is this amazing circumstance due?
Surely not by any means to the fact that he
amassed a huge fortune through his develop
ment of modem industry, for many others in
many lands have done that and their names
are neither known nor remembered. The
rt-ason for -Andrew Carnegie's outstanding
position in the history of his time, with fullest
assurance that he will be remembered through
the years, is that the making of his great
fortune was wholly subordinate to his mag
nificent use of it.
If. as his biographers estimate. Andrew
Carnegie's fortune at its maximum amounted
to some S360.000.000 he gave more than 90
per cent, of it for the benefit and service of his
fellow-men. If those who by reason of ability
or opportunity amass great fortunes in in
dustry. in commerce or in transportation use
their accumulations as Andrew Carnegie used
his. little criticism will be heard of the suc
cessful man of affairs, for in such case he will
have returned to the public service that which
he was able to gain for himself, honestly
enough, through public cooperation and
support.
Observation of scores of those who have
been acclaimed as successful men of business.
and acquaintance with many of them, is
ground for the observation that the modem
multimillionaire has before him four stages of
possible evolution.
The first of these is the acquisitive stage,
when his whole concern is with making money
and amassing a fortune. The second is the
possessive stage, when he hugs his wealth to
his person and identifies it with himself and
himself with it. This is as far as most multi
millionaires ever get. It requires both large
intelligence and fine character to go farther.
The third stage is the contemplative. When
this is reached, the multimillionaire asks,
sometimes quizzically, sometimes seriously,
"What am 1 going to do with this money?"
He usually answers this question by pouring
it out in huge sums upon the members of his
immediate family, thereby wrecking their
lives and the lives of their children and grand
children, until his accumulation is fortunately
dissipated. But it is dissipated only after it
has done its demoralizing work.
The fourth and final stage of this evolution
is the distributive. When this is reached, the
possessor of great wealth is in position to
become an outstanding public servant. If his
ideals are high, his judg
ment good, his knowledge
of men well tested by ex
perience, then he may
quickly climb to the high
est level of public service.
This Andrew Carnegie did.
Born a Scot, and early
becoming deeply im
mersed in American life
and thought, Andrew Car
negie from his young man
hood had a truly amazing
insight into the proper
meaning and significance
of wealth. As far back as
1868, when he was but
thirty-three years of age
and already had an in
come of some £50,000 a
year truly a huge sum
for those days he wrote
t hese extraordinary words:
Beyond this never earn make no effort
to increase fortune, but spend the surplus
each year for benevolent purposes. Cast aside
business forever except for others.
“Settle in Oxford and get a thorough educa
tion, making the acquaintance of literary men
—this will take three years active work pay
especial attention to speaking in public.
Settle then in London and purchase a con
trolling interest in some newspaper or live
review and give the general management of it
attention, taking a part in public matters, espe
cially those connected with education and im
provement of the poorer classes.
“Man must have an idol the amassing of
wealth is one of the worst species of idolatry
no idol more debasing than the worship of
money. Whatever I engage in I must push
inordinately; therefore should I be careful to
choose that life which will be the most elevat
ing in its character. To continue much
longer overwhelmed by business cares and
with most of my thoughts wholly upon the
way to make more money in the shortest
time, must degrade me beyond hope of per
manent recovery.”
Surely this is an extraordinary revelation of
mind and character on the part of a young
man who wrs already demonstrating a capa
city to make money in exceptional fashion,
but who refused to be either tempted by it or
paralyzed by it, as is unhappily the almost
uniform experience of modem men in a like
situation.
Something more than twenty years later.
Andrew Carnegie wrote his famous article for
the “North American Review” which led to
giving the widest currency to his phrase that
he should consider it disgraceful to die a rich
man. John Morley wrote to Andrew Carnegie
that these words would stick to him forever
as an unreserved condemnation of those dying
rich. Oddly enough, there appeared almost
simultaneously Henry George’s “Progress and
Poverty” and Edward Bellamy's “Looking
Backward,” and for some time Henry George,
Edward Bellamy and Andrew Carnegie were
all three widely quoted in the attempt to
answer the question. What are we going to do
with our rich men?
Andrew Carnegie had another marked char
acteristic which greatly broadened his intelli
gence and his outlook, strengthened his
character and guided his judgment in all his
public benefactions and relationships. This
was the habit which he early formed of mak
ing the acquaintance and the friendship of
outstanding leaders in the intellectual, the
artistic and the public life of his time, and
attaching them to himself in bonds of close
friendship. What Mr. Gladstone and John
Morley and Elihu Root meant to Andrew
Carnegie is well known to his intimate
friends, and some record of it all may be
found on the printed pages of his life and
personal writings.
During his months at Skibo each summer,
he was surrounded by a group of men which
probably could not be reproduced anywhere
else on earth. There were to be found prime
ministers, archbishops, heads of universities,
great judges and members of the Bar. leading
scholars, men of letters and men of science
all welded by Andrew Carnegie's hospitable
personality into a company of surpassing in
terest and significance. The conversation
during a week or two at Skibo in those days
will never be forgotten by any who were so
fortunate as to take part in it.
It was because of Andrew Carnegie's fixed
purpose to use his fortune' for the public
service and to be guided in so doing by the
judgment of the ablest men of his time, that
when the distribution of his vast accumulation
was made, it took so remarkable and so un
precedented a form. Andrew Carnegie began
to think of this distribution long before it
actually took place. He turned the whole
matter over in his mind again and again. He
discussed it with his intimate friends and dis
tinguished counselors both in Great Britain
and in the United States. He began in various
small ways —small they must be called in
comparison with what was to come —and
brought comfort and happiness time and
again where there had been distress and suf
fering. and also, through his gifts for public
.libraries, put hundreds of communities in pos
session of those instruments for reading and
study of which they had previously been
deprived.

		NON-UNION MEN
Start Up Carnegie's Armor Plata
Mill at Homestead.

In I'roepect.
Homestead, July 20. The booming;
of cannon' Tuesday morning' announced
to the cltizeub of Homestead that Got.
Tattinon had arrived. A larije crowd
had gathered at the depot Rain was
falling steadily and it was a yery disa
greeable morning for the governor to
make his entry. The governor's priv
ate car was switched off at Munhall
station and the governor went through
the Carnegie mill to the hotel opposite
the entrance. The governor's presence
was not discovered for some time.
Finally word was sent to headquarters
and the cannon in front of Gen. Snow
don's headquarters responded with a
salute of seventeen guns. While this
was in progress the governor was driven
up the hill in an open carriage. The
cavalry acted as an escort. Gen. Snow
den was at headquarter awaiting the
arrival of his chief.
For the first time since thn present
lockout began, the Carnogie Company
yesterday made a pretense of starting
its mills here. It was something of a
surprise to Homestead people to see
smoke issuing from the armor plate
mill in the morning, and they were still
more surprised at noon when the big
whistle was blown for the dinner hour.
The full power of the whistle was not
put in operation, but the people recog
nized the oM-time sound and many of
them looked down toward the entrance
to the works to see if gangs of workers
were not pouring out on their several
ways to dinner. But none came. There
wens workmen inside the works, how
ever, and tliey were pursuing their
duties in a business-like manner, seem
ingly without thought that an armed
guard was necessary to protect Those
men were brought into the works
secretly by the company within the
past. week. They came a few at a time
until Monday, when the company suc
ceeded in getting in s number of work
ers sufficient to guaruntee the starting
up of the armor plate mill.
In the afternoon some of the new
workmen made a protective shield for
heavy marine guns in the presence of a
number of military officers. The start
ing of the mills, following the issuance
of warrants for leaders of the strike,
has shown the advisory committee the
determination of the Curnegie Com
pany officials, but they do not appear
to be downcast at the presence of non
union men in the places of Homestead
workmen. Members of the committee
ins' -it that non-union men can never
run the Homestead mills because Of
their ignorance of the technical branches
of iron and steel, The committee also
has hopes of defeating the company In
the long run on the declaration of a
general boycott by freight handlers,
railroa 1 men, carpenters, masons,build
crs and others engaged in construction
work against the Carnegie Company's
product if non-union men are allowed to
run the mills. Meanwhile the non
union men are ready for another day's
work.
HnMK'TRAii, July 20. No attempt
was made Tuesday to serve warrants
on the five men in Homestead who,with
John McLuckie and Hugh O'DonneU,
are charged with murder committed on
the day the I'inkertons were repulsed.
Constable Weblier, one of the trio sent
out by AlUurmun McMusters, of I'itts
burg, to arrest the five men wanted,
came to Homestead in the afternoon
with subrxrnns for people whose evi
dence is wanted at tho hearing llurgess
McLuckie will receive in Pittsburgh to
day. This duty wasaccomplished with
out trouble.
When the subpoenas Hd been served
Webber went back to Pittsburgh with
out having uttempto l t arrest Ross,
Oitelilow, Flanagan, KurUett or Flu-
herty. These five men were to be seen
nboutthe strei ts.appar.,:'.t'.;.- Indifferent
to t he serious charge made nguinst them.
There wai no attempt made at con
cealment of their presence In town.
The accused men have decided to evade
arrest until after the McLuckie hear
ing. If the biiresi Is admitted to bail
they wi'.l iuliii"iliately surrender and
ask release under l.ond on the same
grounds a tlmse aucd by McLuckie.
They have not made any decision ns to
what they will do If bail is refused the
burgess, but it is probable that they
will give themselves up.
The members of the Amalgamated as
sociation have practically decided to ap
ply for warrants for Mr. Prick, Andrew
Carnegie and others, but are still In
consultation with counsel as to whether
the warrants, if sworn out for murder
and treason, will hold. They are de
termined to offset the action of the com
pany's officials by obtaining thesi war
rants if possible, and the men are confi
dent that they will succeed. They
claim that their caso against the offi
cials of the company Is much stronger
than that of the lutter against any of
the individuals who are now wanted by
the constables. They claim that An
drw Carnegie and Frick are responsible
for sending an armed body of men into
the state without legal authority and
they can le held for treason on this
charge, and that they are also responsi
ble ns accessories before the fact for the
manslaughter which followed.

rest of the strikers fo whom warrants
have been Issued, and all of them will
be compelled to take their innings be
fore the court Judge Magee's court
room was crowded Wodnesday by labor
ing men of tills olty and Homestead.
It had been anticipated that counsel for
the Carneglcs would resist the applica
tion to give McLuckie his liberty and
there were many murmurs of surprise
when, as soon as the case was called,
District Attorney Burleigh arose and
said that having carefully gone through
the evidence with the associate counsel
for the state he conceded thatMcLudMe
was entitled to his liberty. Inasmuch,
however, as the offense was one of con
siderable gravity and in view of the
present situation is the locality, he felt
justified in asking that the ball shoultl
be ample.
McLuokle's ball was fixed at 110,000.
Owen Murphy and Oliver C. Kinton,
two residents of Homestead, qualified
after being put through a rigid exam
ination by the district attorney and Mo
Luckio was released. The crowd filed
out of the court room and gave him a'
ohcer as ho hurried away to Homestead.
In an Interview with Attorney Bren
nan, he said that warrants will be is-i
sued very soon for tho arrests of Prick
and Lovejoy. They will be prosecuted.
He did not say what would be done
about Andrew Carnegie.
Homestead, July 21. Burgess Mo
Luckie was given a big reception when
he arrived in town after his sojourn in
the Pittsburgh jail Nearly 2,000 mill
workers gathorod at the depot and the
brass band was in readiness. When the
train rolled in and the burgess appeared
on the platform there was a tremendous
shout McLuckie was escorted to an
open carriage which was in waiting.
Ho took a seat in the carriage and
Messrs. Lowry and Schuchman, of the
committee, entered the same carriage.
The band led the procession which was
formed and nearly a thousand mill
workers fell In behind the carriage
The procession moved through the prin
cipal streets to the home of Mr. Mo
Lucktc. Thus did the man arrested at
the instance of the Carnogie Company
and charged with murder re-cntor the
borough of which he is burgess.
Exactly ninety-eight men surrounded
the dinner table in the pressing mill of
the Carnegie steel works at noon yes
terday. A reporter gained admission to
tho mill just before noon and was pres
ent when the whistle announced the
noon hour. Fifteen carpenters were at
work on a new house being constructed
between the machine pressing room and
the river.

seen, have amassed greater riches in their chosen

They have outstripped the heads of such houses

their ancestral square miles of lands.
An element common to the character of each of
these three men is a constant, powerful, untir

boast of. They may not know human nature

playwright, they do not waste their talent on
what they regard as Impractable things. Before

		ANDREW CARNEGIE
LIKENS
BOOKER T. WASHINGTON
UNTO
MOSES OF. OLDEN TIMES
Lately Andrew Carnegie presented
his Check to Booker T. Washington
for six hundred thousand dollars, and
In doing so ho declared that "the
founder of Tuskegee is the mod
em Moses of the Afro-American
race; that like Moses of olden
times he will guide or lead
the race into the Promised land which
will flow with milk and honey." It's
true that Andrew Carnegie has suc
ceeded in becoming a billionaire not
by his own genius but because the
United States government has for
years enacted legislation for his spe
cial benefit which has made It possible
for him to accumulate his millions.
But In spite or. his Ill-gotten million
Andrew Carnegie displays his ignor
ance of ancient history whenever he
likens Booker T. Washington unto
Moses of old, for there Is not much
similarity between these two charac
ters excepC that Moses met with a
crushing defeat and failed in his mis
sion and the same fate is in store for
Booker T. Washington.

		MEN OF GREAT WEALTH.
John I). ROekrfellor Taken the Lead
With About $100,000,000.
AN INCOME OF S26.000 PER DAY.
The story has been in circula
tion in Wall street during the pnst
week to the effect that John I).
Rockefeller, the president of the
Standard Oil Truet, is seriously ill,
and that, acting under the advice
of his physicians, ho had deter
mined to stay at hi* residence in
th« suburbs of Cleveland during
the entire summer. Further de
tails were that Mr. Rockefeller was
suffering from nervous prostration,
consequent on close attention to
business. It was believed, how
ever, that if he remained in seclu
sion for six or eight weeks and left
business matters entirely to the
care of others he would be all right
again in the autumn. The story
of Mr. Rockefeller's partial collapse
commanded a certain amount of
belief among Wall street men, for
the reason that the millionaire has
not looked particularly well for
some time past, and those who
have experience in such matters
declare that the strain consequent
upon giving personal attention to
such vast interest as are controlled
by Mr. Rockefeller is bound, sooner
or later to tell on a man's health,
however strong he may be by rea
son of a naturally vigorous consti
tution.
The report regarding Mr. Rocke
feller's illness put forward in the
conservative form here indicated,
has met with a prompt and em
phatic denial at the hands of Mr.
Rockefeller's family in Cleveland
and of his business associates in
New York City. Possibly the
stories as to his bad health have
been exaggerated, but the fact that
the reports have been circulated
has emphasized the rather interest
ing consideration that although
Mr. Rockefeller occasionally oper
ted in the Wall street market, and
although his wealth is probably
three times as great as that of Jay
Gould and equal to the aggregate
wealth of perhaps any ten Wall
street millionaires that may be
mentioned, these reports have had
no effect whatever on the course of
the markets.
Similar reports concerning Jay
Gould, or even Rüssel Sage or The
odore Havemcyjr, would have had
an immédiat» effect on prices and
disturbed the market to a very con
siderable extent. The explanation
is, of course, that although Mr.
Rockefeller has at times purchased
large blocks of stock in Wall street,
and was at one time reported to
have purchased enough Northern
Pacific stock to secure control, he
has never figured as a large specu
lator or as an operator carrying
considerable lines of stock. His
retirement from business, therefore,
eithvr temporarily, or through ill
ness or by death, would not be
attended by the throwing of large
blocks of stock on the market and
any consequent decline in prices.
Outside of this Mr. Rockefeller is
not interested in the railroads of
the country except as a holder of
railroad bonds.
That Mr. Rockefeller is the rich
est man in America admits of no
question whatever. His wea'th is
estimated to be anywhere from i
$125,000,000 to $150,000,000. No I
closer estimate than this can be
made, except by Mr. Rockefeller
himself. Even that gentleman
once declared on the witness-stand
that he was not able to estimate his
çwrn possessions within ten or fif
teen millions of dollars, and this
8 .ate oient was not prompted by
any affectation whatever. Affecta
tion is not one of Mr. Rockefeller's
peculiarites.
About two years ago a Standard
Oil man who is a close personal
friend of Mr. Rockefeller, and who
is thoroughly and accurately posted
as to the inside of Standard Oil
affairs, estimated the Rockefeller
fortune at $129,000,000, and gave
the following figures:
Standard OH stock S40 ,n00,0nn
I'rcnilmns on same 28,min,ooo
Ileal estate lo,onn,ooi>
l.eail trust 2,000,000
Railroad stocks and bonds 20,000,000
Natural wis stock 4,000,000
Bank stock n,ooo,ono
Manufactured gas stock 3,000,000
Steamboat stock (Inman Une, &o.).. 1,000,000
Mines In Utah, Wisconsin, &c 4,000,000
Cash on hand 2,000,000
Miscellaneous 10,000,000
Total Si», 000,000
It will be seen from this state
ment that Mr. Rockefeller's invest
ments are of the most solid, sub
stantial and remunerative descrip
tion. This estimate of his wealth,
however, is confirmed by no less
an authority than Mr. Rockefeller's
associate millionaire, Henry M.
Flagler. Mr. Flagler not long ago
said that he knew Mr. Rockefeller's
income was in the neighborhood
of $9,000,000 a year. Reckoning
that his investments yield an aver
age of 6 per cent, and there is not
much doubt that the gilt-edged
securities he holds pan out at that
figure, this gives him a capital of
$150,000.000. The vastness of this
income may, perhaps, be better
realized when it is calculated that
$9,000,000 a year means something
like $25,000 a day. At the same
time as making the statement re
ferred to Mr. Flagler said that his
own income was $3,000,000 a year
and estimated the wealth of Col.
Oliver Payne another Stanard Oil
magnate, at $22,000,000.
The only man, probably, who
has ever lived in America whose
possessions were larger than John
D. Rockefeller's possessions at pres
ent was William H. Vanderbilt.
There is no reason to doubt that at
the time of William H. Vanderbilt's
death he was worth over $200,000,
000. Indeed a close friend of Van
derbilt once said that Vanderbilt
took him into a safe-deposit vault
and showed him securities that
aggregated even more than this.
W. H. Vanderbilt's wealth, how
ever, was divided up at his death
and no one of the Vanderbilts now
—not even Cornelius Vanderbilt—
has anything like this amount of
money. After Rockefeller, the
wealthiest man in America (o-dav
is unquestionably William Wal-J
dorf Astor, who is worth probably
$100,000,000. Jay Gould is worth,
according to the most careful esti-
mâtes by well-informed Wall street
nien, about $50,000,000 or $G0,000,- j
000. In comparing the Rockefeller I
fortune with the Rothschilds for
tune it must be remembered that
although the entire wealth of the
various branches of the Rothschild
family adds up to perhaps a billion
of dollars, no more than $75,000,
000 is in the hands of any one
member of the family.
In establishing any comparison
between the Rockefeller fortunes
and other notable fortunes held by
human beings on the face of this
earth, this fact deserves to be
pointed out: The Rockefeller for
tune is the accumulation of com
paratively a few years, and it is the
accumulation,of one man and that
by no means an old man. John
1). Rockefeller was born in 1839
and is therefore now only a little
over fifty years of age. He did not
go into the oil business out of
which his vast fortune has been
made until after the war, that is
to say about 1868 or 1869, when
he was about thirty years old.
The $125,000,000 or $150,000,000
mentioned represent, therefore, the
result of a business career extend
ing over a little more than a score
of years. To make one more arith
metical calculation, it may be
pointed out that Rockefeller there
fore made at the rate of between
$6,000,000 and $7,000,000 a vear 1
daughter Bessie, married in 1889
Rev Chas. L. Strong, a young Bap

a roat musician and practices
three h Urs a day< Edith is 8aid
ever since he started in a small
oil refinery with a capital of
$5,000.
Unlike the Rockefeller fortune
great fortunes of America and, of
course, the great fortunes of Europe,
represent the successive and suc
cessful labor of several generations.
The foundations of the Astor for
tune were laid "nearly one hundred
years ago, and when John Jacob
Astor built the Astor House some
thing less than sixty years ago he
was already a very wealthy* man.
The Vanderbilt fortune is thirty
five or forty years old and the
Rothschild fortune dates back to
the last century.
Although John D. Rockefeller
thus seems to be the richest man
in America he lives in a compar
atively modest fashion. He has
never built a palace on Fifth ave
nue, and his equippage is not of
that gorgeous character calculated
to attract attention on the street.
His New York house is at No. 4
West Fifty-fourth street, opposite
St. Luke's Hospital. The house is
surrounded by spacious grounds
and is handsomely furnished, but
there is no ostentatious or even
notable display of the evidences of
wealth. There are no servants in
livery; in fact, there are no men
servants whatever. The door is
opened by a maid in cap and
apron, and maid-servants wait on
the table. It has been repeatedly
remarked, by the way, that Mr.
Rockefeller looks like a preacher.
He is not a large or impressive
looking man, but has stooping
shoulders and solemn face. He is
is fact a deacon in the Baptist
church, and is probably the largest
contributor to the work and institu
tions. He and his family are not
occupying either their house in
New York or the house in Cleve
land. They are apt to go to Green
wich, Conn., or down to the sea
shore for a few weeks. Ailantic
City is frequently chosen.
John I). Rockefeller's immediate
family consists at present of his
wife and two unmarried daughters.
Edith, the elder, is twenty and
Alta is seventeen. Thoy are said
to have a quarterly allowance of
$500 each, and out of this tliey j
dress themselves and pay all their
incidental expenses. The eldest
to be determined to learn Japanese
and to go to that country as a mis
sionary. Presumably J the Rocke
fellers have a great many relatives
about whom nobody ever hears.
The wealth of John D. Rockefeller
will probably be divided up at his
death between the immediate mem
bers of his family and the Baptist
church.
There are two or three interest
ing facts about the marvellous
growth of the Standard Oil Com
pany that have never been put
together. The value of the first
refinery built by Rockefeller was
about $5,000, and this represented
the capital put in by Rockefeller
and Samuel Andrews. Andrews
had been a porter in a commission
house and Rockefeller had formed
his acquaintance while he was yet
a bookkeeper. When the opera
tions of the firm became so great
that the capital, increased by the
rapidly accumulating profits, was
still altogether inadequate, Henry
M. Flagler was taken into the firm
and a new firm created under the
name of Rockefeller, Andrews
Flagler. Flagler's father-in-law,
S. V. Harkness, put in $60,000.

		FROM POVERTY TO
,^^TWO HUNDRED MILLIONS
CHAPTER I.
This is the story of America's wealth
iest man and greatest philanthropist. It
is the history of a man who, with al
most $200,000,000 at his command, gives
art-ay over $500,000 yearly in charity,
says tht New York Herald.
in short, it is the story of John D.
Rockefeller, the Standard Oil Midas,
Croesus, wizard, magician or magnate,
whichever you may choose to call him.
Thirty years ago he was a poor man.
With one uncertain foot on the bottom
rung of the ladder of fortune, he began
to mount with amazing speed toward
the top. He has amassed wealth at
the rate of six million dollars a year
for a period of thirty years. He now
iinds it difficult to keep track of his
property
Ami still the great sold ball rolls on,
accumulating- and increasing with the
years, becoming more colossal and
more formidable as the days pass, until
some day it may require an array of
men to look after it. John D. Rocke
feller does not earn money now as he
did in the old days when his brain was
taxed with the problem of how to make,
instead of how to keep.
Whether he sleeps or wakes, whether
in sickness or health, whether dreaming
away his tjme on his yacht or idling
the days away at one of his many
country homes, his income of $20,000
a day will continue. Should he sleep
for only a minute during an afternoon,
he wakes to the knowledge that he is
$14j-icher than a minute before. Should
he sleep for an hour, $833 roll into his
co#ers in a trickling stream. Every
morning when he opens his eyes he
finds himself $10,000 better off than on
the evening'previous; and this without
an effort other than a few hours' daily
scheming to render his wealth more se
cuce, and to further fasten the finan
cial rivets and cleats that hedge his
RoTfden granary. Yet he was born poor
and penniless, as far as inheritance is
concerned.
T'have said that thirty years ago
John D. Rockefeller was a poor man.
More than that, he was not only poor.
blif fven his best friends would not ac
cord him any credit for industry or
sagacity. He was a plain, plodding
bookkeeper— that is all. What John D.
Rockefeller does not know about his
own wealth would at pres3nt make rich
m«p of thT>se very frietvls. He prob
ably cannot guess within ten million
dollars of how much money he is worth,
without extensive figuring.
Jjahn D. Rockefeller is of Scotch par
entage. His parents came to this co.in
try shortly before the birth of the fu
ture great magnate. The family set
tled in the western part of this state
on -a smaH farm near Moravia. Here
the^ Rockefellers rapidly increased,
until the "family consisted of father,
mother, two sons and two daughters.
From Moravia the Rockefeller family
moved to a farm near Ow^o. At this
time, John D., the eldest son, was a
tall, slender lad, nine years old. The
farm house ocupied by the Rockefellers
at^this time- is still standing. It was
then and is still owned by Mr. G. M.
Lanioiitr,"a well-to-do farmer. It was
In his service that young Ro--:kef filer
°a«ned his first 25 cents, hoe
ing" potatoes. According to a statement
made afterward by Mr. Lanonte. the
boy did the work slowly, >ut well.
TJje two young Rockefeller boys
tvere always together, working on their
mvn little farm, or hunting, Railing and
'iid's nesting about the noun cry. They
iv,-ro not bad boys, as hoys «0,, but
iv ore in for all sorts of harmless mis
chief. And it was on account of this
propensity for harmless mischief that
John onee 'got into trouble w'uh his
mother.
TRIES TO EVADE A SWITCHING.
7?oth John, and William had a great
love and respect for their mother, but
their thoughtlessness was sometimes
the cause of disaster. One day, when
Mrs.' ■Rockefeller was sick, her son
Jolm committed some overt act in con
nectton with the cupboard or the sugar
bowl. He was promptly called in and
arraigned before the awful tribunal
of justice at Mrs. Rockefeller's bed-
Bidet
He acknowledged the corn. Then
he was sent out to procure a switch
f*>r his own punishment. This is an
awful trial for a boy. In his desire
to temper justice with mercy, John
brought in the frailest kind of a willow
affair, _. tha,t would not have hurt a
kitten. Thus early he displayed that
acumen for which he is now so well
known.
l'.ut the scheme did not work. Mrs.
Rockefeller sent William out to pro
cure another switch. William had no
BUCD compunctions. The switch he
In ought in was a peach. He cut it
from the tree in the back yard. It was
large, tough and serviceable. Job did
not take his punishment in unflinching
consciousness of wrong doing like the
grood little boy in the story book.
Oh, no! He howled like a Coman- j
che, just as another boy would have
done. He was a mercurial boy, how
ever, and soon forgot all about it. As
the boys grew up into tall, healthy
striplings, they began to earn more j
money from the surrounding farmers.
"With this transitory prosperity they
developed an astonishing fondness for
the circus, whenever it made a stay
in Owego. From being a desperate pi
rate, with an old threshing machine
for a rakish craft, young Rockefeller
was determined to become a circus j
tumbler or a trapeze performer. He I
concocted a spring board and utilized
all the straw in the neighborhood as a
cushion to preserve his bones.
During the Owego period of the
Rockefeller family's existence the
father was always away from home.
In truth there was some talk of do
mestic trouble, but nobody outside the
immediate family seemed to know
much about it. Mr. Rockefeller sent
money regularly from Cleveland for
his family, and they were fairly well
to do. He visited them occasionally,
but did not stay for any length of i
time.
Among the neighbors young John
Rockefeller had the reputation of be
ing a rather lazy boy, but even at this
early age he showed signs of the strong
■will, calm judgment and perseverance
that have since made him famous.
Who shall say that even while he was
hoeing potatoes or ploughing corn his
mind was not so active that his mus
cles performed their allotted tasks
lazily and mechanically?
Endowed with mental activity and
capacities that were perhaps still un
dreamed of by himself, young Rocke
feller began to long for a wider field
of action. It was only a dream as yet.
His ideas were acute, his character
unformed, his habits unstable and un
settled. "John is too much of a
dreamer," said the neighbors; "he will
never make a good farmer. While sow-
ing his wheat he will be counting upon
the profits of the coming harvest. He
will have it all in the market before
a blade is in sight."
The men who spoke in this wise are
still planting their corn and sowing
their wheat about Owego. Some have
prospered; others have failed and fall
en into poverty. But the boy who
dreamed of unharvested wheat and un
hatched eggs could buy all their farms
rolled into one for a double price, and
then allow the land to lie idle until
the end of time without inconvenienc
ing himself in the least.
REMOVES TO CLEVELAND.
The father of John D. Rockefeller is
said to be still living in Cleveland, al
though he has never occupied the same
house with any of his children. He
lived and labored in Cleveland while
his family were yet in Owego. One day,
many years ago, he suddenly made up
his mind that Cleveland was the beat
place for his family. At this time, John
D. and William Rockefeller were at
tending school at the Owego academy.
The neighbors in Owe^'D rejnrettPd the
departure of the Rockefellers for Cleve
land. Mrs. Rockefeller was a strong
character, well liked by all, and a strict
disciplinarian of the old s^hook Phe
brought the two boys up religousliy
and well, and when, after a six years'
residence in Owego, they started for
Cleveland, both John D. and William
were well behaved youngsters of four
teen or fifteen.
Instead of being ruined by the bustle,
turmoil and temptations of a large city,
the young Rockefellers thrived under
the new conditions. As for .."ihn, the
elder, it was the very thinrj for which
his soul had been yearning. It was a
realization of the dream that had
stricken his muscles with lassitude in
the old farming days.
Again the two youngsters were sent
to public school, where for a while thoy
had a rather hard time of it in amal
gamating their country ideas with
those of the city boys. They had quite
as many youthful disagreemnts as are
usual with boys of their ages, and came
out of them quite as well.
Three years later we find Master
John D. Rockefeller grown into a
strapping young man of seventeen. His
ambitions had outgrown the narrow
}trhvu 2 Ifax*fc2!UAs m
limits of a public school, and he made
up his mind to do and dare 'for him
self. He told his mother about it and
then went his way, looking for a job.
It was not an easy thing to find a po
sition that fitted him.
So it v.-as that young Rockefeller
wandered away to St. Louis. Was it
blind chance that led him to accept the
position of bookkeeper for a small
produce commission firm in Water
street? Nothing better could have
been devised for a thorough training
in busines methods. Neither did it
take Rockefeller any length of time to
master everything ther? was to be
known about the commission business.
He worked early and late on his books
and in the study of the methods of
his employers. He saved his money,
too, and herein lies the difference be
tween John D. Rockefeller and many
of his contemporaries who are still
keeping books In Cleveland.
Young Rockefeller worked with the
Water street commission firm until he
had accumulated something like $500.
He was then nineteen years old. Time
was flying, and its flight made him
restless. He asked himself why he
should not go into business for him
self. His only inheritance \n this world
had been brains and a good constitu
tion. With these he had acquired the
small capital with which he proposed
to do wondrous things In the future.
CHAPTER 11.
It was in 1857 when John D. Rockefel
ler, then a young man of nineteen,
met M. B. Clark, who is now a member
of the elevator firm of Gardner, Clark
York.
The two young men rented a store
and went into the commission business
on their own account. They succeeded
in a moderate way. Rockefeller con
tinued to save his share of the prof-
Its as he had saved his salary, and in
the eight years during which the part
nership continued he had put aside
something like $5,000.
Then the young man was again
stricken with a feeling of restlessness.
He was not making money fast
enough. The commission business had
apparently reached Its limit He
looked about him for an investment
in something more profitable. Dis
satisfaction is sometimes mere ambi
tion after all.
Some time before this Rockefeller
had become acquainted with Samuel
THE Sa£&^°?&Ui/ '&LOBE: SUNDAY, AUGUST 2, 1890.
Andrews, a porter in a commission
store further down the street. In th«
course of a conversation one evening
Andrews expressed his belief that there
was a great future in the petroleum
business. Rockefeller had always
thought so, but had never before ex
pressed an opinion. The conversation
with Andrews gave the decided touch
to Rockefeller's ideas. He consulted
with Clark, and together with Andrews
they built a little petroleum refinery
up the river a short distance from St.
Louis.
Rockefeller and Clark's investment
in this enterprise was $4,000. The firm
still hold onto their commission busi
ness, however. But the petroleum re
finery gave promise of a big business,
and Rockefeller determined to give his
entire attention to it. He tried to per
suade Clark to his way of thinking,
but the latter did not care to venture
into untrodden fields.
The firm was therefore dissolved,
Clark buying out Rockfeller's inter
est. Andrews, who had been superin
tending the refinery on a salary, had
saved a few hundred dollars, and
Rockefeller, knowing him to be a prac
tical man, took him in as partner.
Thus the Standard Oil company
came into being as a commercial en
terprise, one of its originators a book
keeper hardly more than a boy, the
other a porter in a commission house.
The bookkeeper is now president of
the company, while the porter lives in
a three hundred thousand dollar resi
dence.
At the time Clark withdrew from
the little refinery the entire property
could not have been worth much more
than $5,000. It was not much of a nest
egg, yet from this humble beginning
has grown the great Standard Oil
company, with its hundreds of offshoots
and its $70,000,000 of capital. So the lit
tle refinery kept pegging away, with
an ever increasing business and an
ever ambitious management.
In the meantime young William*,
Rockefeller, who had been working at
a salaried position in Cleveland, cam*'
to St. Louis and took a position in the
little oil refinery of Rockefeller An-"
drews. The investment continued to,
pay a handsome profit, and a year or
two after beginning business the firm
had a snug sum in the bank.
A year or two after Rockefeller and
Andrews had joined fortunes they in
conjunction with William Rockefeller,
established a second refinery, and the
money making business was greatly
Increased. The two establishments
were finally consolidated, and the
younger brother, William, was made a,
full fledged member of the firm. A
warehouse for the sale of refined petro
leum was opened in New York, and
William Rockefeller was placed in
charge of it. John D. was the business
head of the consolidated concern, while
Andrews looked after the machinery
and men.
There were no disagreements or
friction. The members of the firm were
very little more than boys, but they
were enthusiastic and ambitious to a
degree. In their lexicon, as they then
regarded it, there was no such word as
fail. They were confronted with
failure, however, shortly after the con
solidation. They had built and pur
chased and planned without regard to
their financial abilities, until finally
they found themselves in very deep
water. They had spent a great deal
of their little hoard in extending their
business, and were threatened with
ruin before they could get returns from
their investments.
Creditors harassed them, their funds
were exhausted and their business was
apparently ruined. "It's no use," said
Andrews. "I guess we are in for it. I
i do not see how we can tide the thing
over."
A PERIOD OF DESPONDENCY.
William Rockefeller was gloomily
desponded. One morning John D. ap
peared at the office of the refinery,
carrying a valise. "Where are you go-
Ing?" asked Andrews. "I am going to
get help," was the reply.
Where he could not tell. He had no
definite plan. But help must be had,
and, just as he had long before set out
to win a fortune, young John D. Rocke
feller took his grip and went forth to
obtain assistance in retaining the little
he had already accumulated. By luck,
instinct, good judgment, or what you
will, he met Mr. S. V. Harkness, a rich
whisky distiller, whose son-in-law,
Henry M. Flagler, was then doing bad
ly in the salt and lumber business near
Saginaw. Harkness Investigated Rocke
feller and the refinery business and
made up his mind that he would take
an interest In it for his son-in-law.
About a month after he had started
out on his still hunt for money Rocke
feller returned with Harkness' Michi
gan son-in-law and $60,000 with which
to continue the business. A new firm
was created, under the name of Rocke
feller, Andrews Flagler.
This was the pivotal point in the for-
Pcs of John D. Rockefeller, as well
of Henry M. Flagler. The money
of-Harkness and the methods of Flak
ier were just what the petroleum re
finery neefled. PrftvhsttfJ to the advent
of. the company had; been con
ducted In a semi-sentimental way."
John D. Ro©kefel|fer's heart had not yet
hardened intojjgranite In l|is business
dealings, although he was tbe princi
pal schemer lflssh<» Ifirm.
It was diffefernfc/ with Flagler. Al
though he hacr* bean far from auccesßr,
ful as a maker of salt and a sawyer'of
logs, he developed remarkable talents
when it came to petroleum. In deal
with opposing refiners he went as far
as the law wwuld permit. He argued
that there was nfeeling in trajfto Consequently when
he got his busUiesa enemy In a hole he
squeezed him
Under these new, tactics the firm of
Rockefeller, Andrews Flagler throve
apace. Their business was extended
amazingly, an&Mn a sort of geometrical
progression. In 1870 the flrm had be
come so imposing and their business
so immense that it jvas thought best to
incorporate under the style of "The
Standard Oil Company," with a cap
ital of $1,000,000. More consolidations
followed. They resembled the consoli
dation of the bird and the worm, but
they were within the limits of business
ethics.
During the days when he was a com
mission merchant John D. Rockefeller
had married a Cleveland school
teacher, Miss Lucy Spellman. The
union proved a very happy one, and at
the time of the incorporation of the
Standard Oil Company he had two lit
tle daughters, Bessie and Alta, who
have since become lovely young women.
Altogether the Standard Oil magnate
has had four children. The oldest
daughter, Bessie, is- the wife of Profes
sor Gfrarles Strong- J>wha occupies the
chair of Professor of Psychology in. the
Chicago imlverstty? "The yoirhgest of"
the four is John D., Jr., who is now 24
years of age. A year or two ago
Edith become the wife of one of the
McCormick boys, of Chicago.
Mrs-. Rockefeller is a slight little
woman, with grayish hair that was
once jet'black. Her life, has been de
voted almost exclusively to her hus
band, her children and her household.
She has never figured in f the society
columns of the newspapers or in great
social events. She tfas'been^ giving
money away in charity continually
since her marriage. The idea of one j
great concern that should control all
the petroleum in this country originate

while John«p. JpfcaMefeller considered

man. It is prob gfeTthat this was the
beginnrnr*of«wr iMifcle.

he wanted for his" sliare. Andrews was
already a rich man. He grew somew4;at,
excited t and, grabbing a piece of paper,
wrote upon it, "One ffiflHon dollars,*
and Jaaaded it to Rockefeller. The lat
ter accepted the offer instantly
the transfer was made.
A few days later Rockefeller sold
the Andrews stock to W. H. Vander
bilt. for $1,250,000, thus clearing a mod
erate fortune on the transaction.
After the retirement of Andrews from
the Standard Oil company the "con
solidations" and extensions continued
without cessation, until practically all
the petroleum output, of this country
was under its control. Then it beg-in
to reach abroad for the control of the
Russian output. Although as yet it has j
pot secured lull control, it has sue- j
ceeded in underselling the Russians*
even in their own country. It seems to
be only a qu«stldn of time, however,
before the Standard will have the oil
markets of the entire world in its
hands.
It was when the Standard Oil com
pany began to be a concern of national
magTrttuiie that John D. Rockefeller
began to give away those magnificent
sums for charity that have made his
name a synonym for benevolence. They
have increased with his growing for
tune until at present his gifts to various
charaties range from $500,000 to $1,000,
--000 annually.
The Standard Oil company in one
sense has been only a bureau for the
distribution of the earnings of the com
panies unc er its control. It has paid, and
continues to pay£*t(et profits to its cer
tificate holders. F6r th»e past eight years
it has paid dividends at the rate of
twelve per qgn£. p^gspar. In, the earlier
years" the profits were not so large, but
they were substantial. IB it any wonder
that under the circumstances John D.
Rockefeller is thA-^i^hest man in the
United States? He once said before a
legislative investigating committee that
he did not knowllhSw rich he was by
several millions. jKp. other man ever
made money so iasff Although fhuch of
his income is derived from the oil busi
ness, his -outside 'tntferests "brrhg him
several millions a' year.
OTHER AMBITIOUS PROJECTS.
In the neighborhood of Puget Sound
there is a. lake 3 but little known to.:
Eastern people. It is called Lake
Washington. It is spring fed, and is
about twenty-five miles long, from
eight to ten miles wide and has a depth
of water sufficient to float the largest
steamships.
Mr. Rockefeller's scheme was to build
a belt line of railways around the lak?,
making connections with the" great
trunk lines running to the East. Next, I
in connection with Gen. Russell A.
Alger, he proposed to build a. canaV
tweive miles long, running from the
lake to the sea. It was to be"a ship
canal, capable of floating steamers en
gaged in the China trade, and was to
become a port of entry which wan to be
come the future metropolis of the coast
north of San Francisco.
Mr. Rockefeller is an iron kinpr as
well as an oil Croesus. He practically
owns all the Lake Superior iron mines,
as well as the principal iron mines of
Cuba. This places him in tho same
position toward the iron producing bus
iness as he has long held in regrird to
oil. To gain control of all these bead
mines has cost him something like
$10,000,000, but the great oil magnate
is a man of gigantic enterprises and
does not balk at a scheme Involving a
mere million or twoT
During the finan/jLil. depression a few j
years ago, when &ifc Jror mine owners
were cramped for money, Mr. Rocke
feller seized the opportunity to buy
everything in sight. He accumulated
all the stocks aridf of Southern
mines that he coirid* get hold of. When
the shares of the Minnesota Iron com
pany were placed on the market he
bought them in. large quantities,
enough in fact to control it. This com
pany owns the great mines at Tower
and Ely, Minn.; the Duluih and Iron
Range railroad, the big docks at Two
Harbors, and large areas of dock and
railroad property >ltf Duluth. It prac
tically held a monopoly of the iron
trade of the North- B
Mr. Rockefeller also has control of the
Mesaba mines in Northern Minnesota,
and Is virtually enabled to dictate the
price of iron. The makers of Bessemer
steel have found that they must have
ore from either Lake Superior or Cuba,
and that they have to pay just what"
price Mr. Rockefeller chooses to place
upon it.
As constituted a few years ago, there
were seven Standard oil companies in
corporated in the great oil trust. They
were in the states of "New York, Perm- I
sylvania, New Jersey, Ohio, Indiana,
lowa and Kentucky. The trust certifi
~eates nave never been dealt in on the
New York stock exchange, because ap
plication has never been made to put
them on its list. The only public
-transactions in them have been at the
auction sales of securities on the real
estate exchange. The last known sale
Was at $190 a share.
The certificates have been as high as
$225, which was before an increase in
Uiem was made to take in new proper
ties controlled by the trust.
When everything is taken into con
sideration, and all interests are figured
out and added up, the wealth of John
D. Rockefeller will be found to be about
aa follows:
Standard Oil stock $50 000 000
hi*? 35,000;000
Real estate 15,000,000

paratively modest fashion. When in

		THE GREATEST TEACHER OF THE NATION.
He is John D. Rockefeller.
Editorial from Hearst's Chicago American.
Mr. John D. Rockefeller reminds the world
of his existence at this moment by giving
5250,000 to Barnard College for Women and
by compelling or inducing others to give 250,
000 more.
It must be said for Mr. Rockefeller that what
he takes away through an ingenious display of
force and skill combined, he occasionally gives
back to the people very intelligently.
Mr. Rockefeller has given many millions to
the cause of education.
Whatever you may think of his way of get
ting the millions, you cannot deny him grati
tude for the motive and intelligence which
direct his gifts.
Mr. Rockefeller's money "does much for edu
cation. Mr. Rockefeller himself is a great
national educator.
If he gave a huudred millions a week to the
cause of education for a whole year, he could
not do as much in the long run for the people
of the United States as he is actually doing in
his daily business life.
He is teaching the power and importance of
industrial organization.
The American people before Rockefeller
arrived had very primitive ideas about han
dling a great industry.
Th ere were thousands of middle men mak
ing tlxir little profits and paying their em
ployes as little as possible.
Oil was dear. Rockefeller comes along,
wipes out the thousands of middle men, makes
them all work, as they should work, organizes
oil production, builds huge pipe lines.
He appropriates to himself a thousand mil
lion dollar? of the wealth that God has given
to the nation. But he makes oil cheap, and he
teaches a lesson in'itidustiial organization.
The railroads are simply the feeders, the car
riers, the messengers of industry. They
should be coutrolled. The people, however,
have no idea how to control the railroads.
But John D. Rockefeller knows how to con
trol the railroads.
The people owning the nation and owning
the railroads ought to establish their own rates
on the railroads. They don't know how to do'
this.
But John D. Rockefeller knows how to .es
tablish his own rates on the railroads
Rockefeller does not go, hat in hand, to the
railroad managers, as does the average poor
farmer or manufacturer, asking, "Will you
kindl) carry my goods, and how much will
you charge?"
Rockefeller sends for the railroad manager.
Hk arrives with his hat in his hand. Rocke
feller says to the railroad manager:'
"I will allow you to carry so mucn freight
for me on such and such conditions, and I will
pay you so much. That's all. Go away."
The manager goes away and does as he is
told, obeying all orders, including the order
not to carry anybody else's oil in opposition to
Rockefeller.
The people of the United States elect, and
they ought to control, their representatives in
congress and in the various state legislatures.
They don't know how to control these law
makers. But Rockefeller knows how to control the
people's representatives.
He defeats them when they come up for re
election if they oppose his will. He never
forgets to reward them if they serve him
faithfully. He never ceases to hound them .if
they attack his interests. In that, he teaches
a sp'endid lesson to the people. They might
just as well coatiol their representatives as
Rockefeller does defeating the unfaithful and
rewardiug the faithful but they don't know
enough. Rockefeller is teaching them.
We are grateful to-day to the reckless pirates
whose courage gave the first great start to nav
igation The merchant dealing honestly travels in the
wake of pirate craft that were first to risk
the open sea. The intelligent merchant whose
ships sail safely to-day is grateful to those old
pioneer pirates.
The people of the future will be grateful to
John D. Rockefeller, the bold, original, capable
and useful pioneer pirate of industry.
He organized a great industry for himself.
He controlled railroads for himself.
He controlled legislatures for himself..
But, consciously or unconsciously, he is
teaching the people of the world how to do all
these things for themselves.
Thes rict duty of the people and of newspa
pers is to watch Mr. Rockefeller and control

		HISTORY OF A FORTUNE,
JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER TO BE A
EiLLIONAiRc.
Million cn Million Delng Piled Up In
Profits From Oil, Railroad and Bank
■—When the Standard Oil King Al
most Went Broke—His Destiny.
Dnvld Graham Phillips writes as fol
lows in the Philadelphia Saturday
Evening Post:
Among the great fortunes of (he
Xvorld today there are two that tower
colossal—-the Rothseshild and the
Rockefeller. No one—not even the
heads of the two houses—knows just
how large these fortunes are. A few
years ago John D. Rockefeller said up
on the witness stand that he was un
able to tell how much he was worth
within several millions. Indeed, there
is no way of estimating accurately
these modern fortunes, invested in
many ways and subject to daily, hourly
fluctuations. Probably a billion and
a half of dollars is as near to accur
acy as it is possible to come in state
Ing the wealth of the house of Roths
child. As for the house of Rockefeller,
a business associate of the elder and
many times the richer of the two broth
ers said within a year: ''John D. Rocke
feller is worth not far from three
quarters of a billion, and he will pres
ently lie the first billionaire the world
has ever had. "If the estimate were
based upon income—certainly as fair
a way as to attempt to value capital
John D. Rockefeller would today be
classed as a billionaire half on the
way toward his second billion. And
there are in addition the several hund
red millions of his brother's fortune,
and the many mUlions of the three or
four allied members of the family.
The Rockefeller fortune was founded
upon credit capital. In 1375 John D.
Rockefeller was a considerable oil
merchant. But his schemes for mon
opolizing the oil business of half the
world were trembling between success
and failure. In that year there were
three weeks when he walked the floor
night after night, sleepless, fighting
the ruin that seemed to be closing in
around him. It is said that his wife
exclaimed: "I wish John would go
bankrupt, for then he would get some
sleep." It is said that the nervous in
digestion which now compels him to
the quietest of lives and to a diet of
crackers and milk at 98 2-5 degrees
Fahrenheit dates from that terrible
three weeks. He owed the banks -of
Cleveland 11,700,000. He could not pay;
they were pressing him, but did not
dare to close In upon him. They knew
that if he failed it would swamp them
and would precipitate a panic in
Cleveland—Cleveland was not so large
and rich in those days, and $1,700,000
was a big sum of money, even in Wall
street.
The Rockefeller fortune may there
fore be dated from 1875, the year when
the founding crisis was passed, though
the big returns did not begin to come
until about 1885, the enormous returns
until less than ten years ago.
From 1860 to 1875 Rockefeller was
reaching out and out to take posses
sion of his promised land. brother,
and their intimate friends^nighed at
him, tried to dissuade him, warned
him. They, too, would buy oil wells,
but they would make what they could
and sell out before the well caught fire
or ran dry. He bought to keep, bought
burning wells and extinguished the
fires, bought dry wells in the hope that
they would some. day yield to the
pump. And when his brother and their
intimates saw that there was method
in his madness, he invited them in,
practically gave them as a present
the shares that were to make them
multi-millionaires. And, slow and 'te
nacious and saturated with his "mys
tic" of manifest destiny, he marched
on to the Montenotte of 1875. The
reaching out on small capital, the ris
ing clamor and fury against his merci
less methods of monopoly, brought on
that crisis.
Until the secret history of the Stand
ard Oil company is written, and it
probably never will be—no one ex
cept John D. Rockefeller will know
how that crisis was passed and how
prosperity and power were obtained
through these contracts with the rail
ways which made competition with
Rockefeller hopeless and forced al
most all the oil men, producers, re
finers and sellers, to choose between
submission and ruin.
Another point in tho development
of the great American fortune Is con
trol of railways—the arteries of the
whole people. It is next in importance
to a monopoly of some natural prod
uct. Rockefeller scored both points.
It w T as about 1884 that some of the
high-priced counsel discovered a way
of freeing him from the bondage of
anti-monopoly law, a method of re
organizing him into legality and safe
ty. Soon tho period of insecurity
passed—though the general public did
not know it and the press and tho
politicians were still howling. Rocke
feller was able to shake off his pur
suers and dismiss his horde of law
yer«. He had at lari a large, secure
income.
And now began the rapid increase.
He was a simple, thrifty man, and so
was his brother. They spent com
paratively nothing of their income, I
I
They reinvested it in obtaining com
plete ownership of what they had only
controlled—that is. of the petroleum
industry. They developed the Stand
ard Oil company from the single con
cern to a conglomerate of about 60
corporations, each engaged in a sepa
rate department of the industry. They
utilized the crude oil in a thousand
ways, turning to account the discover
ies of science which the scientists
gave freely to the world. Soon, so
many and so valuable were the by
prcducts of oil production that the
eil itself cost the Rockefellers practi
cally nothing at all—for the by-prod
ucts more and more paid for its pump
ing, refining, transportation and sale.
For 15 years, Mr. Rockefeller and his
group have been selling about a thou
sand million gallons of oil a year at
prices ranging from 5 to 20 cents a
gallon, and averaging about 7 cents;
and, as the by-products have increased
in number and in value, they have
put into their pockets as clear profit
more and more of the entire selling
price of the oil. Today that selling
price is estimated to be all clear pro
fit, and it is said that there is in addi
tion a profit of from $10,00,000 to $20,
OOO.noO upon the by-products. This
explains why tho profits of the Rocke
fellers from their trust are greater by
many millions annually than the val
ue of tho petroleum production.
About 10 years ago Rockofoiler's in
come was given as $30,000,000 by an
excellent, authority. He had reached
the limit of profitable reinvestment
of profits in the oil industry. Here
then wore those enormous sums i*
cash pouring in—more than $2,000,000
a month for John Davison Rockefeller
alone. The problem of reinvestment
became more than serious. It became
a nightmare. The oil income was
swelling, and, the number of sound in
vestments is limited, was then even
more limited than it now Is. It was
through no especial eagerness for more
gains that the Rockefellers began to
branch out from oil into other things.
The first conspicuous excursion and
incursion of tho Rockefellers was into
I ho railway field. By 1895 they con
trolled one-fifih of the railway mile
ago of the country. What do they
own or, through dominant ownership,
control today? They are powerful in
all the great railways of New York,
north, east and west, except one
where their share 13 only a few mil
lions. They are in most of the great
railways radiating from Chicago. They
dominate in several of the systems
(hat extend to the Pacific. It is their
votes that make Mr. Morgan so potent
—though, it may be added, they need
his brains more than ho needä their
votes—at present, and the combination
of the two constitutes in large meas
ure tho "community of interest."
But railways could not alone absorb
rapidly enough those mighty floods of
gold; presently John D. Rockefeller's
$2,500,000 monthly had increased to
four, to five, to six millions a month,
to $75,000,000 a year. Illuminating oil
wag becoming all profit; the reinvest
ments of Income were adding their
mite of many annual millions.
The Rockefellers went into gas and
electricity when those Industries had
developed to the safe-investment
stage. And now a large part of the
American people must beg^n to enrich
the Rockefellers as soon as the sun
goes down, no matter what form of
illuminant they use.
The latest industry into which tho
Rockefellers have gone is banking.
There they already dominate, and
there they think they have found the
solution of their investment problem—
for a few years, at least. And It is
within the possibilities that the Rocke
feller banking adventure may cause
a convulsion—a greater convulsion,
perhaps, than that which shook the
country when John D. Rockefeller first
introduced the industrial monoply to
the American people jind began to
force Its acquaintance and society
upon them.
The Rockefeller bank—the National
City bank—is by herself far and away
the biggest bank in the United States.
It is exceeded in the world only by
tho Bank of England and the Bank of
France. The deposits average more
than $100,000,000 a day; and it domi
nates the call loan market on Wall
street and the stock market. But it is
not alone; it is the head of the Rocke
feller chain of bank's, which includes
14 banks and trust companies In New
York City, and hanks of groat strength
and influence in every large money
centre in the country.
The chief business cf these banks is
to receive the Rockefeller income and
lean it to speculators, manufacturers,
merchants and farmers throughout
ihe country. And the Rockefellers not
only are relieved from much of their
former anxiety over investments, but
also receive a double profit. There is
the profit of the interest which the
banks pay them for their huge cash
balances 50 and 75 and even of a 100
millions steadily maintained from day
!o day theso largest private handlers
of cash the world has ever seen; then
there are all profits of dividends which
the banks declare—and large dividends
they are.

		STANDARD OIL TRUST
COME TO JUDGMENT
GIGANTIC STRUGGLE WHICH HAS BEEN
BEGUN AGAINST THE GREATEST
OF ALL COMBINES.

Btxre the Methods of the Oil" Octopus John
D, Rockefeller ond the Pixrt He PIolVs
in the Game-In Fifty Yevrs
He Has Become the World's
Greatest Potentate,
John D. Rockefeller has been laugh
ing up his sleeve and serenely waiting.
It has amused him to read in the pa
pers that the Kansas legislature had
appropriated $4lu.(no for the estab
lishment of a state refinery to buck
against his JjyO.oou.noo company. He
has been annoyed, perhaps, at the ef
fort to meddle with his pipe lines, but
he has felt confident that the end
would come in victory for him and the
establishment of his company in the
state on firmer basis than ever before.
He has mapped out a campaign of
waiting. This great financier, this
$r.r,,.o0,0o0 money bags, can afford to
wait, for his dollars work while he
sleeps, and he can keep busy banking
the $."0.000.000 yearly income from his
Investments while the jxor Kansans

said, unless he can buy at ruinously
luw prices and sell at figures which
tell the story of a lair prolit of
several hundred per cent.
We speak of the Standard Oil com
pany and we think of the man who Is
the brains and sinew, yes, and money,
too, of the gigantic corporation John
D. Rockefeller, who began 50 years
ago with nothing and to-day counts
his wealth in the hundreds of millions.
He Is by all odds the richest man in
the world. How did he get within
his grasp all this wealth? What of
the man and what of his methods?
In discussing Rockefeller and his
millions in a recent issue of the New
York World. Karl Mayo dec lares that
nothing in the career of this man has
been accidental except the place of his
birth, which occurred at Richland. N. Y.,
in IS.'il). and about which presumably he
had nothing to vay. The means by
which he rose to wealth was the com
bination of an idea with an opportunity.
Oil happened to be the opportunity, but
if the marvelous richness of the oil fields
never had been discovered' the .idea
would have been applied to some other
business and Rockefeller still would
have been one of the country's richest
men.
We think of trusts as a development
of th last ten or twenty yenrs. but
Rockefeller long before this, yea. 20
years prior, grasped the idea and blazed
the way for the other trusts that have
followed in the train of the Standard.
The control of industry, elimination of
competition, community of interest, reg
ulation of output, consolidation under
a single control, all were a part of his
plan. He led the Standard Oil to Its
present eminence over a rocky road
which has since become smoot h by much
traveling. What was exceptional and
unheard of then has become ordinary
and matter of fact.
Mr. Rockefeller does believe in th
industrial system which he represents
and which he has (lone so much to fur
ther. His commercial creed is founded
upon the theory of'the survival of the
fittest.
"We are better able to run your busi
ness than you are. We will pay you a
fair price for it and will conduct It our
selves, but we will provide for you
by paying you a salary to manage it (or
to do whatever work you are best fit
ted for), and you will thus have a cer
tainty to depend upon Instead of the
uncertainty and the possibility of losing
your entire business which exists under
the competitive system. Therefore, you
will be better off than before. We will
be better off because wo can m ike more
money on a smaller margin of profit
if we handle all tho business. The
public will be better off because, through
the economies of management on a large
scale, it can secure its necessities at a
lower or at least at a more regular price
than before.
"The fact that we make big fortunes
for ourselves by this process is not un
just, for we have demonstrated that we
are more capable than the rqst of you
by getting control of the business.
Therefore wo are entitled to a gi eater
reward, but we feel it our duty to help
you by applying a part of our wealth
to objects that will bo for tho public
Ngood."
This Is the argument that John D.
Rockefeller used in conversation with
his friends at the very time when ho
was securing control of the oil refin
ing business and which he has repeated
since. It is expressed more baldly hero
and with more self-assurance, but thH
is what it amounts to. In an industrial
community ordered by Rockefeller the
shrewdest Intellects would control and
as a corrollary It would follow that their
control would bo for the general good.
As has been expressed In happy phrase
It Is a system of benevolent industrial
feudalism.
Standard Oil Interests $250,000,000.
While anything like an exact com
putation of John If. Rockefeller's wealth
is Impossible, there Is obtainable so tin
data that give interesting glimpses of
its staggering total. Some seven or
eight years ago one of the Standard Oil
leaders. In speaking of the fortunes of
some of the men most prominently
Identified with that company, was
quoted as expressing the opinion that
John I). Rockefeller's share of this
great aggregation of wealth was then
$150,000,000 and that his income from It
was from $12,000,000 to $15,000,000.
This statement had reference of
course only to that part of Mr. Rockefel
ler's wealth derived from his oil Inter

000,000. It is pretty well authenticated, how
ever, that for the past decade Mr. Rocke
feller's yearly Income has been steadi
ly rising from $30,000,000 at the begin
ning of the period to a point at least
two-thirds greater than that at the
present time, and that, during the pre
ceding ten years, it grew from $10,000,000
to $30,000,000.
Lives the Simple, Frugal Life.
Mr. Rockefeller and his family are
modest In habit and expenditure. They
are perhaps the most notable devotees
of the simple life among our multi
millionaires. If we assume that $2. 0mm..
ni'O were expended every year in living
mh1 in charity, it will be seen that th

In the discussion about the affairs of
the Amalgamated rnpper company th
:ame of Rockefeller has been mentioned
frequently, but it has been explicitly de
rbd by the legal representatives of
standard Oil that John I). Rockefeller
ha any interest in this company, in
which his brother, William, and his
close associate. If. H. Rogers, have bee'i
the leading spirits. This statement a
accepted at its face value in Wall street,
where it is known that John I). Rocke
feller has heavy investments in a much
more profitable company, the Amcrica'n
Smelting and Refining.
Other industrial companies in which
he is largely concerned aro the Ameri
can Linseed Oil company, two of the big
express companies, the sugar trust and
the various organizations known collec
tively ks the to bp ''."j trust.
Not a Railway Han, But
John I). Rockefeller is not known as
a railway man. While there are Van
derbilt, Hill, Morgan and Harrlman
systems, there is no combination of
roads known as tho Rockefeller system.
Nevertheless Mr. Rockefeller Is the larg
est Individual holder of railroad securi
ties in the country. He is heavily inter
ested In tho Gould roads Missouri Pa
cific, Missouri, Kansas Texas, Texas
Tadfic and Wabash and It is through
Lis backing and assistance that George
I
i
Gould has been able to fight his way I
successfully against the powerful com-,
bination of railway interests In bringing j
his lines eastward toward the Atlantic t
seaboard. Rut in addition to this he Is
a heavy holder of the stocks and bonds,
more particularly the bonds, of almost
every one of the big eastern lines, as
well as of Northern Securities and of
half a dozen of the big roads running
out of Chicago. Probably not less than
$30,000,000 of his wealth Is Invested In
railways. And It should be borne In j
mind that practically all these holdings
were bought when their market rating
was much less than It Is to-day. i
The solidity and power that come from
the backing of unlimited millions are
valuable assets for a bank or trust com
pany. A number of the most Important
of these Institutions in New York and
other cities have prospered through the
magic of connection with the Rocke
feller name. Certain of these, like the
National City and Hanover banks, of
New York, the First national of Chi
cago and the two largest banks in Cleve
land, are known as Rockefeller institu- t
Hons.
The Country's Richest Banker. j
These are by no means the measure
of Mr. Rockefeller's banking interests.
A well-informed Wall street financier
showed me a list recently of f0 banks
and trust companies, all of which aro
reputed to be more or less under the
Rockefeller influence. If John I). Rock-,
efeller had nothing but his bank hold
ings he would be known as the coun
try's richest banker and would have a
fortune equaled ny lew in the United
States.
Oil, steel, railroads, banks and trust
companies have not been equal to the
task of providing occupation sufficient
for all the fast-multiplying Rockefeller
millions. Within the past ten years
especially a great many of them have
gone Into a particularly lucrative form
of investment city lighting and trac
tion companies. Whether $10,000,000 or
$25,000,000 more nearly represents John
D. Rockefeller's investments of this sort
in and about New York it is impossible
to say, but the amount is likely to bo
near the latter figure, while he has other

large sums similarly invested in New
England and the central west.
Two important items of John D.
Rockefeller's fortune are frequently
overlooked in making computations of
his wealth. These are his holdings of
real estate and mortgages and of gov
ernment and municipal bonds. Roth are
so vast that if we undertook to follow
out the threadc that lead to them they
would take us to every part of the Unit
ed States and across the Atlantic.
While Mr. Rockefeller's real estate
holdings would amount to probably
$10,000,000, such investment does not
prove a very attractive venture for the
astute financier. He prefers to let the
other fellow own tho real estate and he
hold the mortgage. The city of Cleve
land is an example of this. He owns
valuable property there Forest Hills
and his Tarrytown (N. Y.) estate is
truly baronial in its magnificent propor
tions, but these are nothing In com
parison to his mortgage holdings. In
Cleveland he holds a $100,000 mortgage
on the principal hotel, a mortgage for
a like amount on a large wholesale busi- i
ness. and banking and street railway
holdings which would bring the total to
fl5.0oo.oon in the Ohio city alone.
Rut Cleveland is rot the only city In
the United States that is doing a good
part of its business on John I). Rocke-
feller's money and paying him well for j
the privilege. New York. Chicago, Pitts
burg and Ruffah.r. re rases in point. j
Will Be World's First Billionaire.
Of Mr. Rockefeller's holdings In gov
ernment and municipal bonds It were
Idle to speculate. His beneficent atten
tions have been bestowed on other fields,
too. that are not Included in any of the
above classifications, such as that of
the big Insurance companies, steamship
and telegraph and building corporations
and other things, as the department
store advertisements say, too numerous
to mention.
Taking into account all these wide-
spread Interests, it Is not difficult to
figure out that John 1). Rockefeller la
ilready possessed of upward of $050,
300,000, or that, with the power which,
his vast wealth gives him of buying
cheaply when prices are at rock bot
tom and when financial stress compels
the holders of particular properties to
let them go, he will become a full
fledged billionaire within another ten
rears, if he lives so long. Indeed, the
accumulation of his yearly income of
$'i0.000,000. or thereabouts, will carry
him to that point without any allowance
for the appreciation of the properties in
which his money is Invested such as is
certain to occur.
If one were to construct a table show
ing chronologically the growth of Mr.
Rockefeller's fortune It would read about
as follows:

isor $3,000

The World's Greatest Potentate.
From the purely financial point of
view, however, Mr. Rockefeller is easily
the world'sgreatest potentate. The
czar of Russia enjoys an annual income
of about $12,000,000; Emperor William,
as king of Prussia, receives a little less
than $1,000,000; the emperor of Austria
Hungary, $3,875,000; King Edward. $2.
225.000, and the king of Spain. $2,000,000.
In the expressive phrase of Wall street.
King John, as emperor of oil, king of
steel, banking and railroads, and
prince of several lesser dominions,
could buy and sell them all. If he had
to earn his present wealth at the rate
of two dollars a day. which many of his
employes receive, it would take him
something more than 80,000 years to
accomplish the task, or considerably
longer than we have any record of in
human history. It is not merely the
number of John I). Rockefeller's mil

which they convey. By reason of his

ability to reward and punish, to maka
and unmake values, to bestow riches or
ruin, he is almost absolute master not
only of those enterprises in which he
holds a major monetary interest, but In
all those to which he cares tcS turn his
attention in any way. The enterprises
in which he holds investments aggre
gate a capitalization of over $5,000,
000.000. Though he owns outright but a
tenth of this, he can sway the destinic3
of every company involved if he so de
sires. Certainly the world never has seen
such a fortune as this, accumulated In
50 years by the efforts of one man who
has possessed no advantage, except such
as he was able to impose through the
cunning of his brain over any one of
50.000,000 of his fellows, but who never
theless has levied tribute notonly on his
countrymen but. on residents of the re
moteness of China, India and Africa who
never have heard and never will hear
his name, who has worsted opponents
of business resorrces as vast and busi
ness consciences ns elastic as his own,
and who holds to-day the greatest Indus
tries and most powerful financial Insti
tutions In the country In tee hollow of
his hand, the unre.sk-4!: subjects of his
will.
Telling Time by the Scales.
"I happened to be in a butcher shop up
in Harlem the other afternoon," said
Mr. Edward Morgan, the assistant post
master of New York, "when In came a
woman of ample proportions and unmis
takable Hibernian extraction. The

		JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER'S
$10,000,000 GIFT
ANNOUNCEMENT MADE OF A GIFT
OF TEN MILLIONS BY JOHN
D. ROCKEFELLER.
INTIMATED DONOR WILL MAKE
LARGE ADDITIONS TO IT IN
FUTURE YEARS.
New Yortc, July 1.—Ten million
Collars as an endowment for higher
education in the United States has
been given the general education
board by John D. Rockefeller. The
announcement was made by Dr. Wal­
lace Bufetrick of the board at a meet­
ing during the day. The following
letter to the secretaries and executive
officers of the board from F. T. Gates,
Mr. Rockefeller's representative, was
given out:
"I am authorized by Mr. John D.
Rockefeller to say that he will con­
tribute to the general education board
the sum of $10,000,000 to be paid Oct.
1 next in cash, or, at his option, in­
come producing securities, at their
market value, the principal to be held
in perpetuity as a foundation for edu­
cation, the income, above expenses
and administration, to be distributed
to or used for the benefit of such in­
stitutions of learning, at such times, in
such amounts, for such purposes and
under such conditions, or employed in
such other ways, as the board may
deem best adapted to promote a com­
prehensive system of higher education
In the United States."
With the letter the following state­
ment was given out:
"John D. Rockefeller, Jr., with
other gentlemen of this city, was in­
strumental in forming the general
education board in February, 1902. A
very bread and admirable charter was
secured from congress and signed by
President Roosevelt on Jan. 12,1903.
Explanation of th« Gift.
"A gift of $1,000,000 from Mr. John
D. Rockefeller was immediately
passed over to the board, especially
designated for educational work in the
South. Other funds have been added
by other philanthropists since that
time and the bdard has confined its
work hitherto mainly to educational
work in the Southern states.
"The present gift differs from Mr.
Rockefeller's first gift to the board In
the following particulars:
"The principal sum ef the gift of
11,000,000 made on the organization
of the board could be distributed. The
present gift of $10,000,000 is held as
endowment, the Income annually be­
ing available for distribution.
"The first gift was designed to be
used exclusively in the Southern
states. The present gift is for use not
only in the Southern states but
throughout the United States without
distinction of section.
"The first gift could be used for
common schools and secondary edu­
cation. The second gift is confined to
higher education and is designed spe­
cially for colleges as distinguished
from the great universities, although
there Is no prohibition in the letter of
gift against making contributions to
universities.
"It Is known #at Mr. Rockefeller
has had this gift in contemplation for
a long time and Mr. Gates has beet*
studying the subject in his behalf for
many months. If the fund proves to
be is useful as is now anticipated Mr.
Rockefeller will undoubtedly make
large additions to It In future years."

		GIGANTIC FIGHT
COMING 10 ENS
FINAL ARGUMENTS IN EFFORTS
OF GOVERNMENT TO DISSOLVE
THE STANDARD OIL TRUST AT
ST. LOUIS.
St. Louis, April 6. —Before the four
Judges of the United States Circuit
Court for the Eighth Judicial Circuit
the final chapter in the government's
three-year war to disrupt the Stand
ard Oil Company was begun today.
For ten days or two weeks attorneys
for the government and for the Stand
ard Oil company and its 109 co-defen
dants will make final argument on the
evidence already collected at hearings
held in many of the important cities
of the United States and before which
some of the most prominent financiers
of America weTe called.
John D. Rockefeller was not pres
ent at the hearing today. Instead he
and Archbold and other leaders in the
oil industry will be referred to only as
page so and so of the volumes of
printed evidence that have been laid
before the judges.
Under'the procedure of the Circuit
Court only that evidence can be pre
sented which has already been gath
ered and printed. Instead of living
men telling the story of the growth
of the octopus, a dray load of calf
bound volumes will furnish the facts.
After the attorneys have explain
ed the importance and significance
of the replies of Mr. Rogers as to
rate so and so granted to such an
oil company, their honors, the judges
will decorously withdraw from the
court room and by a process about
as exhilirating as reading the en
cyclopedia decide whether or not the
Standard has for two score years
violated the laws of the country.
The umpires who will decide the
case are Judges Walter H. Sanborn,
Willis Van Devanter, William C.
Hook and Elmer B. Adams.
The government forces today were
marshalled by Frank B. Kellogg, of
ficial trust buster. He is one of the
few men who has been connected
with the case all through Its cir
cuitous course. Charles B. Morrison
of Chicago was his chief assistant.
Mortiz Rosenthal and John S. Mil
ler, who shattered the Landis twenty
nine million bubble fine, appeared for
the Standard. There were a half doz
en others seated behind the breast
work of law books stacked on the
counsel table.
For two months the attorneys have
been pouring over the evidence and
mapping out their arguments.
There are nineteen volumes of evi
dence. Each judge and each attor
ney received a complete set. There
are 25,000 pages of questions and
answers. In addition there are 1,500
exhibits. The arguments will be
typewritten and sent to the judges.
It is estimated that by rapid work
they could read through this mass of
material in about two months. No
decision in the case is expected for
at least six months.
From this decision either side has
the right of appeal direct to the su
preme court of the United States.
There the case has precedence and a
final review might be had within a
year and a half.
The evidence was gathered by Spe
cial Examiner Franklin Ferriss, of
St. Lewis. He was apjpointed exam
iner in June. 1907, and began hear
ing evidence September 3, 1907, and
continued from time to time until
January 22, 1909. Since then the
evidence has been transcribed and in
th bands of th printer.
Hearings were held in New York,
Chicago, Albany. Cleveland and St.
Louis. In all there were 444 sepa
rate hearings.
The hearings that attracted the
most attention were held in New
York a few months ago. At these
John D. Rockefeller. John D. Arch
bold. Henry H. Rogers and other
Wall street leaders were present.
Curiosity was so great when Rocke
feller himself was on the stand that
Examiner Ferriss had to have three
policemen in the court room to help
keep order.
Aside from the rather lucid stories
told by the men who have been con
nected with the Standard since its
inception, the evidence was almost
wholly technical and had to do with
rebatps. tariffs, absorptions, cost of
raw material and kindred subjects.
Yet in all the 444 hearings there
was not a question asked that was
not intended to show either the truth
or falsity of the allegations of the
government's complaint.
This document was filed at the in
stance of Attorney General William
C. Moody November 15, 1906, and is
not the least interesting one pertain
ing to ihe case. The complaint itself
covers 194 printed pages, and eighty
two pages of exhibits, mainly con-
Tacts between various oil producers,
are appended.
Through a maize of "saids" and
"aforesaids" can be traced a story
of the Standard Oil Company as in
teresting as any yet written. With
intnße detail the growth of the com
paay tins been given and the con
nection of prominent men shown.
With legal blnntnees the company
is declared to be a gigantic conspir
acy to monopolise the oil business

of the world, and its tactics are des
cribed as unfair and contrary to the]
laws.
The complaint divides the devel
opment of the alleged monopoly Into
three periods: First, that from 1870
Ito 1882 when the individual defend
jants, John D. Rockefeller, William
j Rockefeller, Henry M. Flagler and
i others are described as forming the
Standard and forcing competitors out
of business; second, the period from
1882 to 1899, when the Standard
openly a "trust" operated under a
trusteeship headed by John D. Rock
efeller; third, the period from 1899
to the time of the filing of the com
plaint when the company organized
under the laws of New Jersey, Its
individual leadership lost behind its
corporate personage, is alleged to
have defined the United States and
continually to have violated the
Sherman anti-trust act.
Competition was stifled, the gov
ernment says, by price cutting. This
it declares the Standard was able to
do because of preferential rates and
rebates. The rebates, it is alleged,
were obtained through a conspiracy.
Bogus companies were formed to
crush competition it is declared.
Railroads were forced to use Stand
ard lubricating oil, competitors be
ling forced out of the field. The
United States was divided Into sec
tions each subsidiary company being
given its section so that prices might
be controlled, and there would be no
real competition. And each allega
tion Is backed with figures and maps
and copies of agreements.
The testimony taken has all borne
|some relation to some of the specific
charges in this complaint. It has
been intende to form proof of the
specific charges of unfair and illegal
methods. The testimony is as tan
gled as the story of the trust itself.
Each witness was asked questions
concerning various phases of the
dealings, and in the evidence each
man told facts which bore on specific
allegations scattered from first to
last of the long complaint.

		GULDEN WEDDING

New York. In a secluded corner oí

On that morning she attained her

lng of fortune and all the burdens
that money brings until they reach
an age sufficiently ripe to plan for
i golden weddings. 5
So the Rockefeller anniversary,
v which fell on September 8, was unique
in many ways.
It was in Cleveland, O., on a bright
autumn, day In 1864 that Laura Ce
Jestia Spelman and John D. Rockefel
ler took their nuptial vows. The bride
groom was twenty-five and the bride
was almost the same age, her birth
day succeding her wedding day,
i Their romance had Its foundation
in an acquaintanceship when both
were in grammar school at Cleveland,
and ripened after Miss Spelman had
finished her education at a boarding
school in Worcester, Mass., and re
turned in 1859 to Cleveland to teach,
í Mr. Rockefeller had been, a clerk in
a Cleveland commission house, but
about this time he entered into the
partnership of Clark Rockefeller in
the commission business, and laid the
foundation for his fortune in furnlsh-
lng food supplies to the Union army
at the outset cf the Civil war. His
sweetheart agreed to wait for him
until he had firmly established him
self, and their wedding was deferred
until John,' with the fruits of his com
mission business invested, launched
Into the oil Industry with" Andrews,
Clark Co., In 1862.
Thó story of how Rockefeller rose
to fortune subsequently by the forma
tion of the successive concerns of Wil
liam Rockefeller Co., and the vari
ous Standard Oil companies, culminat
ing in the Standard' trust. Is familiars
to almoBt every schoolboy. But what
of his wife, this little woman of to
dayf 1
Never a strong girl and of less than
average physical- size, she was al
ways of the sweetest disposition ?and
most kindly thought. She was, the
daughter of Harvey Buel Spelman,
who emigrated from his native Massa
chusetts to Akron, 0., where he .be
came a successful dry goods mer
chant. He was an educator and a
member of the Ohio legislature, an
ardent Congregationalist and aboli
tionist. He removed to Cleveland
when Laura was a child. In Cleve
land she attended grammar school,
and after a course in the East taught
in Cleveland for 'five years, giving up
pedagogy for matrimony. Her moth
er was an active W. C. T. TJ. wbrker,
and the daughter followed in her foot
steps. She was indefatigable In her
work for temperance, for the poor,
for those ill She "went about doing
good."
Despite her long residence in New
York city and her immense wealth, she
never figured in the society of the
metropolis. She sought, rather, the
hospitals to visit, comfort and give
financial help to those ill. And when
her children were large 'enough they
made their regular visits to the sick,
carrying flowers. She has .taken a
deep Interest in the ..welfare of col
ored girls in the South,' in 'which
work her father was interested before
her. In fact, Spelman pater estab
lished the Spelman seminary at At
lanta, Ga., for negro girls, and since
his death this institution has been
supported by Mrs. Rockefeller.
Mrs.. Rockefeller's chief occupation
in life has been the rearing' of her
four children. Another child died in
Infancy. Society never claimed her
from her children and she never has
had any interest that was considered
as approaching her family in impor
tance.
Mrs. Rockefeller trained her chil
dren in the ways of thrift just as she
might have done if she had expected
that they would be compelled to make
their own way in life. She set them
an example In, this respect in her
manner of dress and in the direction
of her household, even when this
involved the great home and grounds
at Pocantico Hills, Tarrytown, N.
Y. Her,' sociaf circles always in
cluded only the old friends of the
family friends made during the early
days when nobody suspected that John,
Rockefeller, commission merchant,ever
would be the richest man in the world.
Even this limited number of friends
often was neglected in order that the
mother. might devote all of her time
to her children.
During recent years when Mrs.
Rockefeller appeared in public she al
ways was clad In the same simple
style. She wore a black silk gown
with white lace trimmings at the
throat and cuffs, with a neat black
coat to match. v
Nobody ever discovered that Mrs.
Rockefeller was greatly, interested in
the wealth that her husband spent
his life in amassing. She suffered
much because of it. She suffered when
her husband faced numerous attacks
in newspapers and magazines .that
had to do with his methods of making
money and she suffered when he was
the defendant in several government
prosecutions that were brought on for
the same reason.
'But that practically was the only in
terest she had in the money credited
to her husband's account at the bank
or his numerous banks, to .be. ex
act. Any business man with' an in
come of $5,000 a year cpuld have pro
vided his wife with the 'ame 'luxu
ries that Mrs. Rockefeller enjoyed.
Most of the charities of the Rocke
feller family were left to the husband
or his aids to handle. Mrs. Rocke
feller, however, enjoyed bestowing
funds In certain directions herself.
A needy distant relative was inca
pacitated. A home was built and given
to him free of all cost by Mrs. Rocke
feller. 1
The church interests of this richest
wife have always been important in
her eyes. She was originally a Congre
gationalist. but upon her marriage
transferred her allegiance to the Bap
tist denomination of her husband, and
is now a member of the Euclid Ave
nue Baptist church in Cleveland. As
long as her health permitted, she
was never absent from her pew on
Sunday.
But it is In her home that she shows
to her best advantage. To her guests
she is a hostess royal. Always she
talks of those subjects which are
closest to the hearts of those she en
tertains the rare secret of a success
ful hostess. She makes all feel at
ease at once. There is nothing of the
snob in her. Lovable and companion
able at all times, she is a woman to
whom wealth has brought no change
of. character save to emphasize its
highest qualities.
In recent years she has been in very
Infirm health. But for the tender and
persistent care which she has received
at the hands of her husband she would
probably not have lived until now.
She never sought to buy titles for
her children, though she might easily,
have done so. And she never aspires
to the title of "oil queen" or any other
queen, though Bhe has some, excuse,
for the blood of royalty actually
flows In the veins of her "oil king"
husband.
Such .is the fact, for though not
many know of it, John D. Rockefeller
is a direct descendant of the reign
ing house of England, a lineal heir of
Edward Ironsides, once king, and of
all the succeeding rulers down to Ed
ward JII. Through the third Edward's
son, the earl of Leicester, he traces
his ancestry to the daughter of the
third earl of Lincoln, who married
John Humphrey, early magistrate .of
Massachusetts Bay colony, and whose
granddaughter, Susanna Palmes, wed
Samuel Avery, progenitor of Lucy
Avery, who married Godfrey Rocke
feller, the giandsire of John D.

		JOHN D. HAS PURCHASED BIG
HUNK OF GLORY
New York, Dec. 24. In the last
year John D. Rockefeller has pur
chased ten and a half million dollars'
worth of glory as an educational
philanthropist by distributing that
amount of money to state colleges
and universities, according to a re
port issued by the general education
board. V
Tennessee received $625,000; Tex
as, $400,000; Ohio, $760,000; Illinois,
$300,000; Minnesota, $350,000; Iowa,
$596,516, and other states larger or
smaller donations.
Even Colorado, scene of carnage
not long since when gunmen
imported by the Rockefeller inter--ests
shot down miners and murdered
their wiyes and children, owes credit
to the philanthropist to the extent
of $200,000 donated to universities.
5 But it is from Colorado that the
piteous appeal has come for clothing
for almost naked children and food
fpr starving miners and their fam
ilies. o o

		MINERS AFTER ROCKEFELLER
WANT PROSECUTION
Denver, Sept. 1. Miners are after
John D. Rockefeller, Jr., tooth and
nail, it became known reliably today.
While a militia board of inquiry is
probing charges in connection with
reorganization of the state militia,
and while, it is indicated, the federal
government is taking a hand, it
leaked out here today that as a re
sult of this case and as an outgrowth
of the John R. Lawson conviction, a
concerted effort is under way to get
criminal prosecution of Rockefeller
and others in connection with death
of more than 40 strikers in the re
cent coal strikes.
