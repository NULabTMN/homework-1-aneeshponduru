SOME CARNEGIE HIST6RY.
Crushing Power of The Great Iron Com
pany Untold Wealth.
The bitter struggle at Homestead
between organized workmen on the one
hand and organized millionaires on the
other, gives to the phenomenal career of
Andrew Carnegie, the chief of capital's
iidc in the controversy, a special interest
to Americans, who arc called upon to
lecide by their votes whether or not
they indorse a system which has made
such wholcsarb money-gathering possiblo
to any man, The history of Carnegie's
wealth-making is one of the most extra
ordinary in the history of the United
States, and he differs from every other
American millionaire in his ambitions
and achievements no less than in the use
he has made of his wealth, the distinct
ions which he has striven to obtain, and
the curious mixture of socialism and
imperialism which go to make up his
character.
People in general who read about the
6trikc at Homestead have no idea of the
extent of the Carnegie industries of
wiiich that will, with it3 thousands of
workmen, is but one among many.
Even in Pittsburg, under the shadow of
he vast commercial house which Mr.
Carnegie has built iip, there are thou
Eands of people with no adequate idea
of its extent and resources, of the crush
ing power with which it has stamped
out aspiring rivals or the millions of
profit which it has reaped and of the
long line of huge iron industries which
it has swallowed one after another.
People who read the accounts of the
strike are confused by Various names cm
ployed. There is talk cf Carnegie,
Phipps Co., of the Bessemer Steel Co.,
of the Lucy Furnace, of the Keystone
Bridge Co., of the llartmnn Steel Co. of
Carnegie brothers although there is
now only one Carnegie of the Edgar
Thompson mills and of the Homestead
mills, with a host of others. They all
are Carnegie industries, although
Andrew Carnegie has no share in their
management. The man at the head of
affairs is the Mr. Frick who is taking all
the responsibility. Ho is the head" oFtlie
new concern, the Carnegie Steel Co.
(Limited), which came into being a few
weeks ago and which embraces all the
industries absorbed by Carnegie or
started by him up to date.
This huge ocropus has so many arms
and tentacles t hat only people in the iron
trade arc aware of its vamilicatiens.
Yet the rise of Carnegie and the story of
his life arc as much a wonder to them as
if they knew nothing of the man who
has made himself master of the greatest
industry in the new world. Carnegie
not only founded a great house, but he
has invented a new business maxim and
followed it with marvelous success.
When he ceased to be a telegraph
operator and went into business with
his brother Tom and D. A Stewart,
Carnegie laid it down as a fundamental
principle upon which the partnership
should be conducted that when a partner
died his estate should bo settled up
within thirty days and his interest in the
business acquired by the remaining
partners, and also that no son or child of
any of them should have a share in the
concern or a voice in its management.
This policy has been rigidly followed
down to the present; The consequence
has been that the partnerehip from time
to time has been refreshed and invigor
ated by infusions of new blood and the
active managers have been young and
energetic men. )Yrhcnevcr an employe
or a successful man in some outside but
collateral businees, as in the case of
Frick, displayed unusual ability and
energy, he was taken in, given a share
in the profits and pushed rapidly to the
front.
Both David A. Stewart and Tom Car
negie, who formed tbe original copart
nership with Andrew Carnegie, are now
dead, and each died a many times
millionaire at a time when the business
had not anything like its present
proportions but was growing rapidly.
Mr. Stewart left two sons and Tom
Carnegie more than half a dozen, yet
none of these young men were allowed
to come into the concern, and the estates
of their fathers were settled up im
mediately after death and the business
continued by Andrew Carnegie. The
consequence' has been that the active
management of" the business has been
intrusted to bright and active men wlib
have grown up on iron.
All of theso partners have become
millionaires. To be suro thGy are not
millionaires of the Carnegie magnitude,
having to strugglo along with from one
to ten million!. This was the case with
Henry Phipps. He is one of mlnoi
partners, whose name has not even been
mentioned in connection with the Home
stead strike, and yet he lives in England
in a palace and maintains an establish
ment like one of the princes of the blood.
Indeed there is not in England a princ
with a house as line as Kneb worth Park.
Stevenage, Herts, where Henry Phippi
and his family are now residing.
This magnificent house is the count rj
stat of the Lyttons, and from there the
late Lytton was buried. Knebwoith
which has an immense aemcsnc ana ar
estate of thousands of acres, with every
thing which wealth, care and time car
add to make it a delight to the eye, wai
at one time a royal palace, and has beer
in the family of the Lyttons since abou1
1470. It was purchased then by Sii
Robert de Lytton, who was Undei
Treasurer jof the Exchequer to Ilenrj
VII., and Queen Elizabeth with othe;
subsequent sovereigns have been enter
taincd within its ample walls
The fortunate tenant of this establish
ment has, however, been through tin
mill at Pittsburg, and the yeMv of'tol
lie has put in piling up the Carnegie
millions as well as his own entitle him
to the case and comfort which it is
presumed he now enjoys there. Mr.
Phipps, who, unlike Carnegie, lias never
aspired to literary or political distinct
ion, was recently presented at court,
with his daughter and other members of
his family. Rigged out in the ornate
costume which a man is obliged to put
on when he goes to court, the partner of
Andrew Carnegie may be highly
Interesting from a picturesque stand
point, but does not add much to the
dignity of American citizenship.
Carnegie, as the cable has told the
puUic, is living now in lordly luxury at
Cluny Castle, Scotland. 1
Here is what a recent writer had to
say about the goings-on at the castle
"Mr. Carnegie has a pljjer of his own,
who pipes each day for dinner, the
company marching two and two behind
him thrice around the hall in solemn
Srocession until led by the host to tho
Ining-room." The same writer, in
farther description of this famous piper,
says that ho is always "resplendent in
tho Carnegie tartan." Thcro is no
Carnegie tartan, and James Grant's
book, "Tho Tartans of tho Clans of
Scotland," docs not CTcn mention tho
name of the family. Tho "Carnegie
Tartan," therefore, which tho piper at
Cluny Castle wears, must not only havo
been made out of whole cloth, bujt it
must havo been invented by Mr. Car
negie. Perhaps he wears tho kilt him
self. People who know Carnegie havo
told him that his manly form coald be
set off to no better effect than if he were
to don the cap, the stocktngs and the
sporran. f"v i
III3 NEW niGIILAKD SEAT. I
But ho is now at Cluny Castle.
Klnlochrannoch, Perthshire, is the name
of his new country seat fn the, Highlands',
and here his grounds embrace thousands
of acres of mountain and moorland,
brawling burn and silvery loch.
In Ids splendid house in New York,
No. 5 west Fifty-first street, Carnegie,
who has filled tho establishment with
Scotch servants, has invented a coat-of-arms
which reporters who have Inter
viewed him in his library hav.e seen
emblazoned on tho walls. It consists of
loaves of bread quartered with a knife,
sausagos, heads of cabbages, etc., in
yules, azuro and ermine and all painted
with a wretched disregard of art.
Much attention is given to Spain'
young six-year-old king. The proba
bilities are that when that kid is old
enough to be a king the world will bo
too wise to admit of any such foolish
ness even in old bcnjclitcd Spain.
Sixty-cent wheat, five-cent cotton,
lower prices for cattle and everything
else produced are arguments that are
silently but surely doing a work in
opening the eyes of men that have here
tofore been deaf to the appeals of
reason.

hoped by the managers of the Croker-Devery

York to believe that Mr. Carnegie indorsed the
Tammany administration, and would aid the
organization in perpetuating its misrule of the
city. Mr. Carnegie was in Europe when the

		Nine! The deep-toned bell of the
cathedral clock in Andrew Carnegie's
mansion at Fifth avenue and Ninety
first street, New York, has chimed
the quarters in a musical scale, and
is booming the hour as the master
reaches the doorway of his workshop.
As he stands for a moment on the
threshold of his library, his small,
lithe figure is the incarnation of quiet
force and nervous energy. He has
said publicly that he is out of busi­
ness for good. He is about to begin
a busy day, in the course of which
he will accomplish twice as much
work as many a man in the hurly
burly of lower Broadway who is still
in active command of his forces as a
captain of industry.
System is Andrew Carnegie's
watchword. Although no longer
directing the movements of 200,000
employes in the great steel works
and other enterprises with which his
name was so long associated, he con­
tinues to be the man of affairs, and
each day brings its iabors, none the
less exacting because they are pri­
marily for the good of humanity and
not for personal gain.
It is estimated that Mr. Carnegie's
income is $15,000,000 a year. Of this
he gives away two-thirds at least.
Exactly how much of his fortune is
dispensed in public and private gifts
no one knows but himself. To dis­
tribute money so that the greatest
good to the greatest number shall re­
sult is the business of his life, and
he devotes at least ten hours a day
to this task with all the vigor and
concentrated shrewdness which have
made the former peasant boy of Dun­
fermline one of the wealthiest men
in the world.
Ah, the morning papers! To read
some of them and look through the
rest is the first thing to be done. Mr.
Carnegie is a rapid reader, and as
his interest extends to all parts of
the world, it is well that he is, for he
reads everything1 in the paper, from
the foreign cable dispatches to a
skimming over the advertisements.
The papers disposed of, he rings
for his secretary, James Bertram, a
Scot, like his employer quick-witted,
too, or he never would do for Andrew
Carnegie.
"What's new, Bertram?" he asks,
pleasantly* as he picks up one of the
pile of letters which have been placed
at his elbow, open and ready to be
scanned.
"Nothing particular You will find
several orpin requests in that pile
which look all right, and there is an
answer from that Indiana town about
their library. There are two person-'
al letters for you, too.* Oh, yes, you
have them."
This with Scottish directness and
military brevity, as Mr. Carnegie
breaks the seal of one of the two let­
ters, 'which have been placed on his
table unopened. Very

York Hortie—Perfect System in Each Hour of Labor.
any misconception, let it be said
here, positively, that writing the word
"Personal" on an envelope will not
deter the secretary from opening it.
Mr. Carnegie has gone through the
first letter and makes a short memo­
randum on it. The same with several
others. Then he takes up one from
a Western city which tells him that
the authorities there have decided
not to accept his offer of a library
because public feeling is against
using the required sum from the
municipal treasury every year to
support it. He elevates his eyebrows
in a shadow of vexation, and dictates
a reply to Bertram, who jots it down
in shorthand. The reply is courteous.
It expresses regret that the town will
not take a library, on the terms of­
fered, but declares emphatically that
the conditions which govern all other
library endowments cannot be modi­
fied in this case.
By the time the correspondence is
disposed of, and Mr. Bertram's note­
book is full of pothooks for Campbell
to turn into typewritten letters, the
forenoon is well advanced, and a pile
of newspapers from other dfties, in
America, q.nd abroad, are ready for
Mr. Carnegie's attention. He reads
the mall. Many are complimentary,
but there are some which criticise
the use he makes of his wealth, or
take issue with certain opinions he
may have expressed in speeches,
magazine essays or newspaper inter­
views.
All of these receive due considera­
tion and even when a prominent hum­
orist raps him hard—as one did
a few weeks ago—he only smiles in­
dulgently. N6 one realizes better
than Andrew Carnegie that to be in
the limelight of public view means
many an unkind comment, as well as
a fair quantity of praise, so he takes
the bitter with the sweet with equal
composure.
It is now time for luncheon. Mr.
Carnegie steps into one of the auto­
matic elevators and is taken to the
dining room. There is not much done
in Mr. Carnegie's room for an hour
'or two after dinner. He has spent
more than an hour at luncheon, in
domestic privacy, and when he re­
turns to his den it is to sit quietly
reading for hour before the car­
riage fs announced fort the afternoon
drive in the park.
But he cannot spend much time in
the park this afternoon, for he is due
to attend the opening of one of his
libraries on the east side. He has
promised to be present and make a
short address, and he will keep' his
word. The carriage has heen ordered
to be in readiness on his return from
his walk, and by 4 o'clock he is on
the platform in the new building, fac­
ing a large audience He shakes
hands with a few scores of persons,
and is rescued' from some hundreds
of others who would like to grasp his
hand, and drives back to his home.
He is Jin particularly good spirit
now, and id ready for a lot more'cor­
respondence. There have been sev­
eral mails in the course of the day,
and the mountain of letters which the
secretary has winnowed has resulted
in a pile for his personal considera­
tion even larger than that which
faced him in the morning. He goes
through them rapidly, and then he
has the' evening NeV York papers
and a lot of blue penciled papers from
other cities.
Visitors have been coming and
going all day, but, with the exception
of a. committeeman, he has not seen
any of them. He has a public dinner
engagement at the Waldorf-Astoria
for the evening, and has no time to
talk to any one whose business is not
imperative.
Six o'clock sounds from the big
hall clock and its companions, and
Bertram and Campbel disappear. As
they go out a cheery voice is heard
in the hall, and Mr. Carnegie smiles.
He recognizes the tones. In another
inoment, Charles M. Schwab, presi­
dent of the United States Steel Cor­
poration to the world at large, but
"Charlie" to Andrew Carnegie, is
seated in the den, laughing and talk­
ing. They may talk steel business,
but if they do it is only in a casual
way. Andrew Carnegie has passed
through a busy day, and he has still
that dinner to attend at the Waldorf
Astoria.
"Let's have some music," suggests
Mr: Carnegie, leading the way to the
magnificent pipe organ, which is one
of the luxurious features of the Car­
negie palace.
"All right," responds "Charlie," as
he seats himself in front of the in­
strument, "what shall it be?"
Andrew Carnegie has dropped into
a chair in front of the fireplace, and
his gaze is fixed among the red coals.
He smiles without answering. The
fingers of the musician sweep the
keys and "Ye Banks and Braes" thun­
ders through the great house. Then
comes "Annie Laurie," followed by
"The Bluebells of Scotland." The
quiet figure In the chair is* perfectly
still, save for a gentle nodding of the
head in time to the thrilling melody
that brings back old memories, old
times and many faces dead and gone.
Again the air changes and there are
tears in the music as the organ seems
to say articulately, "Robin, Robin
Adair."
Perhaps there are tears in the keen
blue eyes of the great multi-million­
aire and philanthropist, sitting so
quietly before the fire. If there are,
they cannot be seen, for the night
has been closing in and the musi­
cian is playing by the sense of touch
alone, as the listened still looks into
the red coals, dteaming, dreaming,
dreaming.—New York Herald.

Third Man Injured In Civil War.
We clip the following from the Peo­
ple's Journal, Scotland's greatest week­
ly, on Andrew Carnegie, who is known
across the water as "The Laird of
Skibo," and which may be of interest
to our readers:
The Carnegie week in Piitsburg was
recently celebrated with great rejoic­
ings. As in former years stories of the
millionaire and incidents of his early
life were on everybody's lips. It was
stated that Andrew Carnegie came by
his fondness for books and libraries in
a legitimate way. His father was a
Scotch Liberal, a weaver of Dunferm­
line, and was one of three men, all
weavers, who, 75 years ago, gathered
their little handful of books together,
and placed them at the disposal of their
fellow-workmen. Shortly after Andrew
Carnegie graduated from the woollen
mills of Allegheny and became a mes­
senger boy in the Pittsburg "Tele­
graph" office, he had his own first ex­
perience with libraries and librarians
in his attempt to acquire knowledge.
At that time there was a wretched little
free library in Allegheny on Federal
street, just above Colonade Row, the
property made famous in the Jack Rob­
inson will case in Media. Andrew Car­
negie made aplication for books, and
was refused on the plea that he was
not a "working boy." At that time
clerks, telegraph operators, and other
boys and young men not employed in
mills, factories, or workshops were not
regarded as "working boys", and as
he was a telegraph operator young Car­
negie was refused the privilege of the
library. At this time young Carnegie,
as he subsequently confessed, had a
burning desire to become a reporter
and subsequent the editor of a news­
paper. He did not achieve his ambi­
tion, but he has always been exceed­
ingly ready with his pen and tongue.
Stung by his rebuff at the Allegheny
library young Carnegie made an attack
on that institution in the Pittsburg
"Dispatch," over the signature "Work­
ing Boy," with such signal success that
he forced the librarian to ask an inter­
view, at which the differences were ad­
justed and Carnegie was admitted to
its privileges on the score of being a
"working boy."
One of the three "don'ts" credited to
Mr. Carnegie is "don't speculate." The
other two are "don't drink," and "don't
Indorse." And yet Andrew Carnegie's
colossal fortune is based on speculation.
With a number of others, shortly after
the oil excitement broke out in north­
western Pennsylvania, Mr. Carnegie
took a "flyer" in petroleum, and pur­
chased 300 shares of stock in the Storey
Oil farm, on Oil Creek. Oil was as
great a gamble then as it is today,
and so Mr. Carnegie took the risk. Luck
was on his side, as it has ever been.
At first the venture did not promise
to be a success. He became discour­
aged, and sold one-third of his stock
at a nominal figure. He went to Scot­
land on a visit, and while there some
big wells wer struck, and he came back
to find that his shares were worth
hundreds of thousands of dollars. His
ultimate profit was $1,000,000. While a
great deal has been said about Andrew
Carnegie, very little is heard about his
brother, Thomas, or "Tom," as he was
familiarly known in Pittsburg. Thomas
Carnegie was the antithesis of his
brother Andrew. He was tall and slen­
der, and did not bear the marks of his
Scottish origin as plainly upon his face
as his elder brother. He was a nervous,
wiry man, whose inseparable compan­
ion was a Pittsburg "stogie." He was
a partner in the Carnegie interests,
president in fact, and was lifted into
financial and social life by Andrew as
the latter rose. Thomas Carnegie has
been dead a dozen years, and is almost
forgotten now by all save his associates
of that time.
The old Hope cotton mill in Allegheny
where "Andy" Carnegie worked is still
standing, although it is not in opera­
tion. From the cotton mill he rose to
be a messenger boy, and it all came
about through his father's love of play­
ing checkers. The elder Carnegie used
to visit Pittsburg to meet some check
er-playing cronies, among whom was
Jofon Brooks, then a clerk or manager
in the Pittsburg Telegraph office. One
night Mr. Carnegie, in speaking of his
elder son, said that he did not know
what he was going to do with Andrew.
"Send him over and I will make a mes­
senger boy of him," replied Brooks.
Tliat is how Carnegie got into the tele­
graph business. In the same office with
him as messenger boys were four other
lads who have since become famous
in one way or another. They were
Robert Pitcairn, now superintendent of
the Pittsburg division of the Pennsyl­
vania railroad, and many times a mil
ion aire Henry W. Oliver, another great
iron master of Pittsburg, whom it is
said Senator Quay has selected for his
successor in the senate David M'Cargo,
another railroad man, and William C.
Moreland, for many years. a leading
lawyer of Pittsburg. Andrew Carnegie
was one of the little handful of men
who witnessed an epoch in telegraphy
45 years ago. It was the sending of thq
first message from New Orleans to New
York. It was considered a wonderful
thing, almost impossible of achieve­
ment.
In those days operators worked on
short circuits, but the managers de­
cided to try the experiment of wiring
from the far south to the north. James
D. Reid was general superintendent of
the telegraph line, with headquarters
in Pittsburg. On the day set for the
trial, Superintendent Reid, David
Brooks, and Carnegie, M'Cargo, Oliver
Pitcairn, and Moreland, who were then
operators, gathered round the instru­
ment adjusted for the purpose. At a
signal, New York called Philadelphia,
Philadelphia called Harrisburg, and
then in quick succession Pittsburg, Cin­
cinnati, Louisville, Memphis, and New
Orleans opened. In describing that
scene, one of the number said recently:
—"For a moment there was absolute
silence in the office. No one seemed to
breathe, so great was the tension. Then
came a few faint ticks growing louder,
and an instant later an unbroken mes­
sage was sent between the north and
the south." In every instaiice the men
who have cast in their lot with Andrew
Carnegie have been lifted into wealth
and prominence. Those who have
dropped out have not always retained
their good luck. The latter is the case
of some of his old partners. Andrew
Carnegie is what the Rothschilds would
call a "lucky man." Their house will
have nothing to do with unlucky men.
Andrew Carnegie would be a perfect
treasure to them. One of the little
known episodes in Andrew Carnegie's
life is his connection with the civil war.
He was the third man wounded during
the Rebellion. When Thomas A. Scott
undertook to help President Lincoln as
assistant secretary of war in the mat­
ter of railway transportation. Carnegie
was placed in charge of a portion of the
telegraph work. He followed General
Butler's troops southward on an engine.
He rode on the pilot inspecting the
wires. At one point between Eldridge
Junction and Washington he found that
the Confederates had 'grounded" the
wires by pinning them to the earth. He
stopped the engine to release them. As
he did so one of the wires bounded up,
cutting a deep gash in his cheek, and
he entered Washington his face cov­
ered with blood.
Some years ago Mr. Carnegie was
asked to make a subscription toward
a library at Lincoln, Neb. The first 25
dollars had been given by an Omaha
man, Mr. Rosewater, of the "Bee."
Years before this Mr. Rosewater had
been a telegraph operator at the time
that young Carnegie was also an oper­
ator in Pittsburg. They had "talked"
frequently over the wire between the
cities where they were employed, but
had never met. It was Mr. Rosewater
who made the request for a donation
from Mr. Carnegie. It was forthcoming
very promptly, and in sending a mag­
nificent subscription Mr. Carnegie re­
cognized the bond of a telegraphic
brotherhood in a peculiar way. Down
in a corner of the letter below his sig­
nature he wrote "Sevnty-three," which
in the sound manual of the telegraphers
is a code signal used in exchanging
greetings. It was his greeting with his
check to his former brother telegrapher.</text>

		Andrew Carnegie, Maker of Millionaires
Deceased Ironmaster, While Rolling Up His Billion, Made Millionaires of More Than
Twoscorc Partners, Men Picked Fzom the Throng Because of Their Potential Ability
Many of These Men, Such as Schwab, Frick and Corey, To-Day Rank Among the
Wealthiest Men of the World.
ALL great captains of Industry
and finance In gaining great
ncnes tnemaeives maice oiner
men rich, but with the excoptlon of
Plcrpont Morgan sr., who dollbor-
ately picked out young men and
guided tbem along the paths leading to
wealth, Andrew Carnegie waa the
only autocrat of Industry and finance
who ever designedly made the fash
ioning of millionaires a by-product of
his own wealth-accruing activities.
He was a pioneer In that line, biasing
the way when millionaires were com
paratively scarce In Uila country, nnd
his by-products. In tho ranks of whom
are such men as Cbarlea M. Schwab,
Henry C. Frick and William B. Corey,
to-day rank among the wealthiest
men of the worm.
In his early days Andrew Carnegie,
by vlrtuo of his Scotch blood, waa a be
liever In Individual industry aud fru
gality. In his memolra he says be ac
cumulated his first $1,000 by saving
the money a few dollars at a time, but
other paaaagea Indicate that he had a
winning way and waa able to procure
aid from banks and capitalists In lay
ing the foundation of his fortune. Do
that as It may, he waa a believer
hard work and aavlng habits, but he
waa not long In coming to the Idea
that the short cut to wealth Is through
the efforts of others.
His first job entailing responsibility
was assistant to Thomas A. Scott. Su
perintendent of the Pennsylvania Rail
road Col Scott was a railroad man of
the old school. He believed In doing all
the Important work of his office with
his own hands, and he trained young
Carnegie along those lines.
"But," wrote Mr. Carnegie, "a few
years ago, after he had retired from
business, "I think Mr. Scott ,and I
were the most foolish men In the
world In that respect
"It took me some time to learn, but
I did learn that the supremely great
managers such aa you have In these
days never do any wprk themselves
worth speaking about; their point la
to make others work while they think.
I applied this lesson In after life, so
that business with mo baa never been
a care,
Col. Scott by the way, waa one of
Andrew Carnegie's first by-products.
Impressed by Carnegie's business abll
Ity, Col. Scott gave tho young man
his first opportunity to make money
outside his pay by advising blm to
buy (S00 worth of Adams Express
Company shares and to Invest $500 In

When Andrew Carnegie went into the
steel business ho made Col Scott one
of his partners and one of the early
steel millionaires.
When ho had foreseen that steam
railway would soon be compelled to
replace, their wooden bridge's by steel
structures ami had decided to make
the steel bridges Andrew Carnegie
cast about for likely young men to
aid blm In his enterprise. He found
ed In the early seventies the Key
atone Drldgo Company. His original
partners were William P. Shlnn,
David McCandless, nenry Phipps and
Thomas Carncg'e. These partners
conducted the plant and Andrew
Carnegie raised the money and sold
the goods and attended to the adver
tising. Ho wna tho first great Indus
trial press, agent, and his methods
awed and disgusted the,old timers In
the steel business, but he got the
business and the money. Subsequent
ly he took into the Keystone Drldgo
Company Thomas N. Miller, William
Coleman, Andrew Klomon, J. Edgar
Thompson, John Scott, DaVId A. Stew
art and John W. Vandervoort
The steel Industry waa flourishing
In Western Pennsylvania and North
ern Ohio In a small way. The meth
ods of the old-timers were conserva
tlve. Andrew Carnegie's bridge con
cent grew like a mushroom and he
began learning things about the ateel
manufacturing business every mln
ute. He found that many labor eav
lng and productldn speeding devices
had beon Ignored by tho steel Makers
and that therp were Jn the trade many
young, ambitious men who were not
getting a chance. He gathered up
some of these 'young men and wont
Into the steel business.
Aided by a prohibitive tariff and tho
tremendous railroad expansion In the
late seventies, the Carnegie enterprises
would have grown to great propor
Uons along natural business channels,
but he forced them. He began in
anlrlng his superintendent and sub-
superintendents by gifts of atock In
the concsrn. He made them partnsr,

three of these partners, ,not one of
whom bad paid a cent for stock which
was earning from $0 to 60 per cent
per annum. He drove these men aa
Simon Legree drove Uncle Tom, but
ho waa a benevolent Simon Lcgree.
He ro warded toll munificently and he
weeded out the men who could not
stand the pace with scant ceremony
or consideration. Occasionally a val
ued partner -would break down. He
would be promptly ptgeonbold and a
new, eager, striving, ruthless young
man would take his place.
The army of clerks In the Carnegie
enterprises were keyed up to the ut
most endeavor by promises dangling
always before them of stock bonuses
nnd promotions to salesmanships or
superintendences. In the mills, the
skilled workers were paid ataggorlng
iagea and many with Ideas were
picked for promotion. Of the thirty
three partners of Andrew Carnegie In
1S$9, only three had more than an
elementary school education. The
others had gone into the milts as
boys and worked their way up.
Those were rough, strenuous days.
Andrew Carnegie applied to the fullest
extent of his remarkablo powers of
organization his point "to make
others work while I think." Henry
C. Frlok, one of his partners at that
period, brought to the Carnegie Inter-
ests five-sixths of the Henry W.
Oliver holdings in the Mesaba ore
range without the actual expenditure
of a cent Later. Frick had a falling
out with Carneglo hlch resulted In
the reorganization of the Carneglo
interests. For hla services In bringing
about this reorganization, James D,
Dill, the corporation attorney, was
paid a fee of 1.000,000,
When J. P. Morgan and the, allied
Wall Street Interests saw that the
Indomitable Carnegie, who thought
all the time and drove others to work
for him all the time, was In a fair
way to carry out his threat that he
would grab control of the steel and
ore business of the continent they
bought him out He had forty-
four partners; none of whom had paid
a dollar for his stock, and all were In
the millionaire class or approaching
It Many others bad dropped out of
the organization either to retire from
business or to go Into aome branch
of the ateel Industry on theJr own
account
Among those millionaires who wero
the by-products of Mr. Carnegie's
closing years In business were Wll
Horn E. Corey, Charles M, Schwab,
George Lauder, James Qaylct A. T.
Dinkey, F. T.. F. Lovejoy, John a. A.
Lelshman, P. T. Derg. Henry Docnth-
rager, Thomas Lynch, W. W. Black
burn and H. P. Dope. All of the
partners, who were active to tho close
of Mr. Carnegie's control, profited by
tho sale of the Carneglo steel in
terests to the United States 3teel
Corporation and named the President
of the United States Steel Corpora
tion for five years after bo retired
from active business.
The formation of the United States
Steel Corporation was the means of
making millionaires of hundreds of
men. who had not been with tho Car
negie organization, and theso are In
direct! responsible to Carnegie for
their wealth, for he made possible
the United Statca Steel Corporation.
Tho aggregate wealth of tho million
aires Andrew Carnegie mode directly
or Indirectly amounts to many times
more than Carnegie's fortune at the
peak of his prosperity.
After he retired from business he
looked after the widows of many of
the. men he had raised to wealth, pay
lng them 6 per cent on their money
and protecting them In their holdings
by bond. At one time he had on his
books the names of 148 of these
widow depositors and the amount ho
held for them waa $$,1S7,82.20.

		STEEL MASTER BEGAN
TO SAVE WHEN YOUNG
Recognized That Success Lay In Sound
Investment-Safest Security in
World Is Now Offered By
Government.
Andrew Carnegie died not long ago,
leaving behind him $30,000,000. He
had given away about $300,000,000 in
an effort to avoid the reproach of
dying rich.
It is probable that the high cost of
living gave the "steel master" little
worry during th? latter half of his
life, but it is certain that in his boy
hood the prices of the necessaries of
life were vital factors. And Andrew
Carnegie in his early years met'the1
cost of living with the same remedy
which America's leaders, headed by
President Wilson, are now putting
?h as the biaic principle of the
t to withstand the menace that
s in the soaring prices of today,
t remedy IB thrift-the practice of
ng, the elimination of waste and
id investment,
the days when Andrew Carnegie,
?ears old, earned $1.20 a week as
abbin boy in an Allegheny City
on mill, and later when he earned
25 a month as a telegraph mes
:er boy, the cost of living meant
h to him. He had little margin
for saving. But he did save. There
were few opportunities for the small
saver to make safe investments. Se
curities were not issued in small de
nominations. There were no Thrift
Stamps or War Savings Stamps,
backed by the government, into which
the meager proceeds of the Scotch
boy's thrift could be converted.
But Andrew Carnegie at the age of
20 determined upon safe investment.
The soundest securities that offered
were 10 shares of stock in an express
company worth $600. Carnegie had to
borrow part of the money he paid.
But he was convinced that savings ly
ing idle were not performing their
proper function.
The American man or woman, boy
or girl of today does not have to bor
row to add to the savings fund in or
der to find safe investment. The gov
ernment makes sound security in the
form of Savings Stamps, Trtasury
Savings Certificates, and war bonds
available to /ery saver who will be
gin to practice thrift by the regular in
vestment of sums as small as 25
cents.
Every American today has a better
opportunity for success than lay be
fore Andrew Carnegie when he faced
the world.

		The Fruits of a Fortune
What should a rich man do with his money
^Andrew (arnegie's answer was to invest one

work forever to improve man's lot. Dfow the whole
world is celebrating the centennial of his birth

Andrew Carnegie was bom at Dun
fermline, in Scotland, on November
25. 1835. The centenary of his birth
is now to be celebrated in most
distinguished manner both in the United
States and in Great Britain. These celebra
tions will be echoed throughout the civilized
world, for there is no land in which Mr.
Carnegie's name is not known and none
which the influence of his idealism and fore
sight have not reached.
To what is this amazing circumstance due?
Surely not by any means to the fact that he
amassed a huge fortune through his develop
ment of modem industry, for many others in
many lands have done that and their names
are neither known nor remembered. The
rt-ason for -Andrew Carnegie's outstanding
position in the history of his time, with fullest
assurance that he will be remembered through
the years, is that the making of his great
fortune was wholly subordinate to his mag
nificent use of it.
If. as his biographers estimate. Andrew
Carnegie's fortune at its maximum amounted
to some S360.000.000 he gave more than 90
per cent, of it for the benefit and service of his
fellow-men. If those who by reason of ability
or opportunity amass great fortunes in in
dustry. in commerce or in transportation use
their accumulations as Andrew Carnegie used
his. little criticism will be heard of the suc
cessful man of affairs, for in such case he will
have returned to the public service that which
he was able to gain for himself, honestly
enough, through public cooperation and
support.
Observation of scores of those who have
been acclaimed as successful men of business.
and acquaintance with many of them, is
ground for the observation that the modem
multimillionaire has before him four stages of
possible evolution.
The first of these is the acquisitive stage,
when his whole concern is with making money
and amassing a fortune. The second is the
possessive stage, when he hugs his wealth to
his person and identifies it with himself and
himself with it. This is as far as most multi
millionaires ever get. It requires both large
intelligence and fine character to go farther.
The third stage is the contemplative. When
this is reached, the multimillionaire asks,
sometimes quizzically, sometimes seriously,
"What am 1 going to do with this money?"
He usually answers this question by pouring
it out in huge sums upon the members of his
immediate family, thereby wrecking their
lives and the lives of their children and grand
children, until his accumulation is fortunately
dissipated. But it is dissipated only after it
has done its demoralizing work.
The fourth and final stage of this evolution
is the distributive. When this is reached, the
possessor of great wealth is in position to
become an outstanding public servant. If his
ideals are high, his judg
ment good, his knowledge
of men well tested by ex
perience, then he may
quickly climb to the high
est level of public service.
This Andrew Carnegie did.
Born a Scot, and early
becoming deeply im
mersed in American life
and thought, Andrew Car
negie from his young man
hood had a truly amazing
insight into the proper
meaning and significance
of wealth. As far back as
1868, when he was but
thirty-three years of age
and already had an in
come of some £50,000 a
year truly a huge sum
for those days he wrote
t hese extraordinary words:
Beyond this never earn make no effort
to increase fortune, but spend the surplus
each year for benevolent purposes. Cast aside
business forever except for others.
“Settle in Oxford and get a thorough educa
tion, making the acquaintance of literary men
—this will take three years active work pay
especial attention to speaking in public.
Settle then in London and purchase a con
trolling interest in some newspaper or live
review and give the general management of it
attention, taking a part in public matters, espe
cially those connected with education and im
provement of the poorer classes.
“Man must have an idol the amassing of
wealth is one of the worst species of idolatry
no idol more debasing than the worship of
money. Whatever I engage in I must push
inordinately; therefore should I be careful to
choose that life which will be the most elevat
ing in its character. To continue much
longer overwhelmed by business cares and
with most of my thoughts wholly upon the
way to make more money in the shortest
time, must degrade me beyond hope of per
manent recovery.”
Surely this is an extraordinary revelation of
mind and character on the part of a young
man who wrs already demonstrating a capa
city to make money in exceptional fashion,
but who refused to be either tempted by it or
paralyzed by it, as is unhappily the almost
uniform experience of modem men in a like
situation.
Something more than twenty years later.
Andrew Carnegie wrote his famous article for
the “North American Review” which led to
giving the widest currency to his phrase that
he should consider it disgraceful to die a rich
man. John Morley wrote to Andrew Carnegie
that these words would stick to him forever
as an unreserved condemnation of those dying
rich. Oddly enough, there appeared almost
simultaneously Henry George’s “Progress and
Poverty” and Edward Bellamy's “Looking
Backward,” and for some time Henry George,
Edward Bellamy and Andrew Carnegie were
all three widely quoted in the attempt to
answer the question. What are we going to do
with our rich men?
Andrew Carnegie had another marked char
acteristic which greatly broadened his intelli
gence and his outlook, strengthened his
character and guided his judgment in all his
public benefactions and relationships. This
was the habit which he early formed of mak
ing the acquaintance and the friendship of
outstanding leaders in the intellectual, the
artistic and the public life of his time, and
attaching them to himself in bonds of close
friendship. What Mr. Gladstone and John
Morley and Elihu Root meant to Andrew
Carnegie is well known to his intimate
friends, and some record of it all may be
found on the printed pages of his life and
personal writings.
During his months at Skibo each summer,
he was surrounded by a group of men which
probably could not be reproduced anywhere
else on earth. There were to be found prime
ministers, archbishops, heads of universities,
great judges and members of the Bar. leading
scholars, men of letters and men of science
all welded by Andrew Carnegie's hospitable
personality into a company of surpassing in
terest and significance. The conversation
during a week or two at Skibo in those days
will never be forgotten by any who were so
fortunate as to take part in it.
It was because of Andrew Carnegie's fixed
purpose to use his fortune' for the public
service and to be guided in so doing by the
judgment of the ablest men of his time, that
when the distribution of his vast accumulation
was made, it took so remarkable and so un
precedented a form. Andrew Carnegie began
to think of this distribution long before it
actually took place. He turned the whole
matter over in his mind again and again. He
discussed it with his intimate friends and dis
tinguished counselors both in Great Britain
and in the United States. He began in various
small ways —small they must be called in
comparison with what was to come —and
brought comfort and happiness time and
again where there had been distress and suf
fering. and also, through his gifts for public
.libraries, put hundreds of communities in pos
session of those instruments for reading and
study of which they had previously been
deprived.

		NON-UNION MEN
Start Up Carnegie's Armor Plata
Mill at Homestead.

In I'roepect.
Homestead, July 20. The booming;
of cannon' Tuesday morning' announced
to the cltizeub of Homestead that Got.
Tattinon had arrived. A larije crowd
had gathered at the depot Rain was
falling steadily and it was a yery disa
greeable morning for the governor to
make his entry. The governor's priv
ate car was switched off at Munhall
station and the governor went through
the Carnegie mill to the hotel opposite
the entrance. The governor's presence
was not discovered for some time.
Finally word was sent to headquarters
and the cannon in front of Gen. Snow
don's headquarters responded with a
salute of seventeen guns. While this
was in progress the governor was driven
up the hill in an open carriage. The
cavalry acted as an escort. Gen. Snow
den was at headquarter awaiting the
arrival of his chief.
For the first time since thn present
lockout began, the Carnogie Company
yesterday made a pretense of starting
its mills here. It was something of a
surprise to Homestead people to see
smoke issuing from the armor plate
mill in the morning, and they were still
more surprised at noon when the big
whistle was blown for the dinner hour.
The full power of the whistle was not
put in operation, but the people recog
nized the oM-time sound and many of
them looked down toward the entrance
to the works to see if gangs of workers
were not pouring out on their several
ways to dinner. But none came. There
wens workmen inside the works, how
ever, and tliey were pursuing their
duties in a business-like manner, seem
ingly without thought that an armed
guard was necessary to protect Those
men were brought into the works
secretly by the company within the
past. week. They came a few at a time
until Monday, when the company suc
ceeded in getting in s number of work
ers sufficient to guaruntee the starting
up of the armor plate mill.
In the afternoon some of the new
workmen made a protective shield for
heavy marine guns in the presence of a
number of military officers. The start
ing of the mills, following the issuance
of warrants for leaders of the strike,
has shown the advisory committee the
determination of the Curnegie Com
pany officials, but they do not appear
to be downcast at the presence of non
union men in the places of Homestead
workmen. Members of the committee
ins' -it that non-union men can never
run the Homestead mills because Of
their ignorance of the technical branches
of iron and steel, The committee also
has hopes of defeating the company In
the long run on the declaration of a
general boycott by freight handlers,
railroa 1 men, carpenters, masons,build
crs and others engaged in construction
work against the Carnegie Company's
product if non-union men are allowed to
run the mills. Meanwhile the non
union men are ready for another day's
work.
HnMK'TRAii, July 20. No attempt
was made Tuesday to serve warrants
on the five men in Homestead who,with
John McLuckie and Hugh O'DonneU,
are charged with murder committed on
the day the I'inkertons were repulsed.
Constable Weblier, one of the trio sent
out by AlUurmun McMusters, of I'itts
burg, to arrest the five men wanted,
came to Homestead in the afternoon
with subrxrnns for people whose evi
dence is wanted at tho hearing llurgess
McLuckie will receive in Pittsburgh to
day. This duty wasaccomplished with
out trouble.
When the subpoenas Hd been served
Webber went back to Pittsburgh with
out having uttempto l t arrest Ross,
Oitelilow, Flanagan, KurUett or Flu-
herty. These five men were to be seen
nboutthe strei ts.appar.,:'.t'.;.- Indifferent
to t he serious charge made nguinst them.
There wai no attempt made at con
cealment of their presence In town.
The accused men have decided to evade
arrest until after the McLuckie hear
ing. If the biiresi Is admitted to bail
they wi'.l iuliii"iliately surrender and
ask release under l.ond on the same
grounds a tlmse aucd by McLuckie.
They have not made any decision ns to
what they will do If bail is refused the
burgess, but it is probable that they
will give themselves up.
The members of the Amalgamated as
sociation have practically decided to ap
ply for warrants for Mr. Prick, Andrew
Carnegie and others, but are still In
consultation with counsel as to whether
the warrants, if sworn out for murder
and treason, will hold. They are de
termined to offset the action of the com
pany's officials by obtaining thesi war
rants if possible, and the men are confi
dent that they will succeed. They
claim that their caso against the offi
cials of the company Is much stronger
than that of the lutter against any of
the individuals who are now wanted by
the constables. They claim that An
drw Carnegie and Frick are responsible
for sending an armed body of men into
the state without legal authority and
they can le held for treason on this
charge, and that they are also responsi
ble ns accessories before the fact for the
manslaughter which followed.

rest of the strikers fo whom warrants
have been Issued, and all of them will
be compelled to take their innings be
fore the court Judge Magee's court
room was crowded Wodnesday by labor
ing men of tills olty and Homestead.
It had been anticipated that counsel for
the Carneglcs would resist the applica
tion to give McLuckie his liberty and
there were many murmurs of surprise
when, as soon as the case was called,
District Attorney Burleigh arose and
said that having carefully gone through
the evidence with the associate counsel
for the state he conceded thatMcLudMe
was entitled to his liberty. Inasmuch,
however, as the offense was one of con
siderable gravity and in view of the
present situation is the locality, he felt
justified in asking that the ball shoultl
be ample.
McLuokle's ball was fixed at 110,000.
Owen Murphy and Oliver C. Kinton,
two residents of Homestead, qualified
after being put through a rigid exam
ination by the district attorney and Mo
Luckio was released. The crowd filed
out of the court room and gave him a'
ohcer as ho hurried away to Homestead.
In an Interview with Attorney Bren
nan, he said that warrants will be is-i
sued very soon for tho arrests of Prick
and Lovejoy. They will be prosecuted.
He did not say what would be done
about Andrew Carnegie.
Homestead, July 21. Burgess Mo
Luckie was given a big reception when
he arrived in town after his sojourn in
the Pittsburgh jail Nearly 2,000 mill
workers gathorod at the depot and the
brass band was in readiness. When the
train rolled in and the burgess appeared
on the platform there was a tremendous
shout McLuckie was escorted to an
open carriage which was in waiting.
Ho took a seat in the carriage and
Messrs. Lowry and Schuchman, of the
committee, entered the same carriage.
The band led the procession which was
formed and nearly a thousand mill
workers fell In behind the carriage
The procession moved through the prin
cipal streets to the home of Mr. Mo
Lucktc. Thus did the man arrested at
the instance of the Carnogie Company
and charged with murder re-cntor the
borough of which he is burgess.
Exactly ninety-eight men surrounded
the dinner table in the pressing mill of
the Carnegie steel works at noon yes
terday. A reporter gained admission to
tho mill just before noon and was pres
ent when the whistle announced the
noon hour. Fifteen carpenters were at
work on a new house being constructed
between the machine pressing room and
the river.

Belt. Robinson and Rockefeller, it may thus be
seen, have amassed greater riches in their chosen
i Ids than those born to great estates an.i
reared with the sole view to Increasing them.
They have outstripped the heads of such houses
as the Rothschilds, the Astors, the Vanderbilta,
ar.d the titled men of wealth of England, with
their ancestral square miles of lands.
An element common to the character of each of
these three men is a constant, powerful, untir
ing desire for gain. It us a purpose which they
boast of. They may not know human nature
l.alf as well as some dramatists, but, unlike the
playwright, they do not waste their talent on
what they regard as Impractable things. Before
his son's Sunday school class, at the Fifth
Avenue Baptist Church, of this city, Mr. Rocke
feller once said: "I believe it is a religious duty
to set all the money you can." To Cecil Rhodes,
his associate in the diamond business at Kir-
berley, Mr. Belt said: "My sole pleasure is the
making of money. I once found Joy in spend- 1
Lng it, but that wa3 before I called myself rich." I

The Hague. Nov. 7. Final decision has at last
been reached concerning the Carnegie P*ac«
Palace. The announcement was made th- other
day that the Dutch government had porcbaaad
a plot of land situated at the eastern end of The
Hague, behind the Botanical Gardens, to be
given to the Carnegie committee. Following
that it was officially announced that the future
palace of arbitration would be built on the plan
of the Brussels Palace of Justice, of which It
will be an exact copy on a smaller scale.
The estimated of*?t of the peace pa'are La
$1,040,000, or about one-fifth the amount ex

		ANDREW CARNEGIE
LIKENS
BOOKER T. WASHINGTON
UNTO
MOSES OF. OLDEN TIMES
Lately Andrew Carnegie presented
his Check to Booker T. Washington
for six hundred thousand dollars, and
In doing so ho declared that "the
founder of Tuskegee is the mod
em Moses of the Afro-American
race; that like Moses of olden
times he will guide or lead
the race into the Promised land which
will flow with milk and honey." It's
true that Andrew Carnegie has suc
ceeded in becoming a billionaire not
by his own genius but because the
United States government has for
years enacted legislation for his spe
cial benefit which has made It possible
for him to accumulate his millions.
But In spite or. his Ill-gotten million
Andrew Carnegie displays his ignor
ance of ancient history whenever he
likens Booker T. Washington unto
Moses of old, for there Is not much
similarity between these two charac
ters excepC that Moses met with a
crushing defeat and failed in his mis
sion and the same fate is in store for
Booker T. Washington.
